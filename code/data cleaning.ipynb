       "array([Looks like there is thread here that discusses a very similar/same problem you describe. Extract from that link  by ddevejian » Thu Apr 02, 2015 2:11 am  All right, its working.    I found a couple of comments in other forums that suggested that the \"Family 0 for 00-XX00000000000.YY is not registered\" message is not an error, but typical behavior for the 1wire driver when nothing is attached.     Based off of that, I reattached my circuit and started to double check everything. Looking at the datasheet for the DS18B20, the input voltage is 3.0 to 5.5. Thinking that perhaps the 3v3 pin wasnt delivering sufficient voltage for whatever reason, I tried the 5v0 on pin 2. Still no love. However, when I changed the ground pin from pin 9 to pin 6, low and behold it started working. (Ive since moved back to the 3v3 on pin 1 for power and it continued to work.) For the moment Im going to assume there is a break in my ribbon cable or the T-Connector I used to connect the GPIO to the breadboard. Digging into exactly whats happening there will be a labor for another day.    I appreciate your help, Joan.My guess is it is the same Joan who is top rated contributer here. Might want to thank him/her if the solution works for you.,\n",
       "       I've had this problem in the past and it was related to the power supplied for the DS18B20s (in parasitic mode).I'm the problem is now resolved, but I'm not sure specifically what fixed it. In my /boot/config.txt I have:dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=4,pullup=on and in /etc/modulesw1-therm strong_pullup=1Again, not sure specifically what fixed it, but hopefully this helps.,\n",
       "       After having had the same problem, I found out what caused it.I measured the voltage over the sensor, and it was 0.0 Volt. I had misinterpreted the pin-layout, and swapped it 180 degrees.I moved the connetions to the correct end of the socket, and now things work just fine.,\n",
       "       Looking at the datasheet for the DS18B20, the input voltage is 3.0 to 5.5. Thinking that perhaps the 3v3 pin wasnt delivering sufficient voltage for whatever reason. Change it to the 5v0 on pin 2.,\n",
       "       When I did a test run of this on OpenElec XBMC I noticed the same issue.I was trying to get it to run with a WiFi USB (supported or unsupported I could not get it to work)By default XBMC will ALWAYS USE LAN even if you set-up up WiFi. Make sure your LAN gives out DHCP and that the default gateway is set.After I plugged in my LAN cable it took about 10~15 minutes and all the add-ons started to show up. For the first time something runs in the background each add-on one by one to make sure they are stable or if new versions are available. During the initial 10~15 minutes I got message like  \"plugin-b.x is no longer supported - Would you like to remove it from the plugins source\" I pressed no (but in the list it marked as unsupported/broken)After that I could download any plugin I wanted. (except iPLayer for BBC which I really really really wanted.. damn :( but most of the others are there. The GUI is slow compared to PC but it still is very impressive as it plays Xvid, DivX out of the box! about 15fps on ModelB and Full 30fps on H264! nice)I read the is a secret console available for debugging.. try and read up about that. It might be that even you have DHPC the XBMC cannot find its way to the internet for one or another reason like DNS, GateWay, OLD IP.. etc,\n",
       "       Choose Programs, then your OpenElec settings. Under Network, use WLAN, then wlan0 and put in your settings. Under Network 2, choose NONE for the second adapter. This will force your XBMC OpenElec build to use WiFi only.,\n",
       "       Try using Samba if you have a Mac, or ssh. That worked for me. BTW, did you \"install from the zip file\" or just \"install addons\"? Also, you can try the Ethernet connection rather than using WiFi adapter.,\n",

       "       The electrical connections required depends on the servo you have. The GPIO provides 3.3&nbsp;V and up to 16&nbsp;mA, which is insufficient for your servo, so you will need to buffer it with a transistor.There are 8 GPIO pins on the expansion header, though other pins can be reconfigured to give up to 17 GPIO pins in total. If you need more, you will have to add some kind of multiplexer.Getting precisely timed signals will be tricky on the Raspberry Pi, or on any non-real-time OS, as interrupts and task switches can happen any time. You will probably need external electronics to provide accurately timed signals.Andrew has pointed you to some software. The CPU load will depend on what you are doing, but the GPIO itself does not add any load.,\n",
       "       I'd be surprised if you can time the outputs sufficiently well whilst running Linux to accurately control a servo.The pulse has to be controlled over a range of 2 milliseconds.  Even if the scheduler tick has a resolution of 100us (which is pushing it - it's usually 10ms), that's only 20 steps you can resolve.  And that's without considering the jitter introduced by task switching.If there's another timer available, you could potentially write a very low-level driver which can pre-empt even the OS to get it's timing accurate.  Sounds like fun!,\n",
       "       Servos are, generally, controlled using PWM signals; you should refer to GPIO as PWM output.There is PWM support on the chip, so we should be able to use that in the future. Basically, all the software does is tell the hardware to produce pulses at a certain frequency. Some people have had success using external PWM controllers over I2C.,\n",
       "       If you are running a realtime operating system on your Raspberry Pi this is indeed possible. As others have said already you will need an external power source to the servos but except for that you do not need any other additional hardware.If you are running Xenomai (realtime patch for Linux) you can run a completely familiar Linux system, but with added realtime capabilities.I have written a tiny C library for the purpose of controlling servos from the Raspberry Pi. I have tried controlling 3 servos at the same time with it, but there's really no reason why it shouldn't work with more.You can find my tiny library here: https://github.com/simonfi/pi-servo Adding a Python wrapper for it should be trivial. Xenomai for Raspberry Pi can be found here: http://powet.eu/2012/07/25/raspberry-pi-xenomai/Generating the needed signals for three servos is basically consuming a negligible amount of cpu. I have not tested with more than three yet.,\n",
       "       If you don't mind using a Linux Kernel driver there is servoblaster which exposes the servos as a char device. https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBitsI have forked a new version which does not consume all of the gpio pins for servos use. I'm currently using such on a small servo driven robot the I have built and demoed for our robot club using IPGamePad to control it.https://github.com/jronald/PiBitsAlso, you really don't want power that servos via the RPI but instead use a separate power supply. Of course you need to tie that grounds together. Since the RPI outputs to the servo no voltage shifting is required, but you will want to be very careful to not wire things incorrectly. ,\n",

       "       I think that trying to run a servo directly from the GPIO port would be difficult and cause a lot of CPU overhead if it's even possible.  I use a USB servo controller and it works great and uses almost no CPU, although it is a little tricky to set up. The one I have is 24 channels, but they do make a 6 channel version.  I have also seen 2 and 4 channel controllers from other vendors that use serial which would be easier and cheaper than USB if you do not need to control so many servos.,\n",
       "       Knowledge of how to do things on the Pi has improved quite a lot in the years since this question was asked.There are at least four ways of generating hardware timed PWM/Servo pulses on the Pi's gpios without using external hardware.The use of kernel modules to do this is pretty much deprecated, The following userland solutions are available.My own pigpio will generate Servo and general PWM pulses independently on any of gpios 0-31 (C, Python, socket, pipe).Servoblaster will generate Servo and general PWM pulses independently on up to 21 gpios (pipe).RPIO will generate Servo and general PWM pulses independently on any of gpios 0-31 (Python).pi-blaster derived from Servoblaster (pipe),\n",

       "       Two approaches come to my mind: Get yourself a remote control like they have it in model-aircrafts. Let the servos act the valves/switches of the ball roller. A decent 4 channel RC with receiver and 4 servos should be around $ 150 max. Thus you save the hassle of dealing with AC mains.If you want to raspify your ball roller just get you two Pis with 2 WiFi dongles. The one on the ball roller you want to set up as an access point. It's GPIO must be galvanically seperated from AC mains. You achieve this by using a set of opto-couplers. The output of the optocoupler might trigger a relay/contactor which in consequence switches the valves. The other Pi you set up as a WiFi client. Its GPIOs connect to push buttons.

This is possible by running for example apt list raspberrypi-ui-mods --installed. This lists the version of the package if it is installed.If you want to do know if Pixel might be installed from without using apt, you could search for packages listed in /var/lib/apt/extended_states that match such a system.You can be quite sure if you find the following entries:pix-plym-splash (pixel plymouth splash screen)pix-icons (pixel icon set)This might already give you a good start and might even be enough for most situations as most people won't install a boot splash screen and an icon set specifically designed and branded for a desktop environment they don't have installed. Just my two cents.There are much more clues to be found though, and with some digging on what components Pixel consists of (or uses by default, like lightdm) you could also find out which folders/files, init scripts and configuration files are needed for those components to run. Ultimately, you could then conclude from their (non-) existence in the filesystem if Pixel is installed.Keep in mind though that in linux many different combinations of packages might achieve the same thing, meaning that you might under some circumstances face a situation where somebody runs just some parts of some common combination like, lets say, Pixel.You might then be able to tell that there is a GUI based on lxde installed together with a lightdm display manager that is sporting the pi-greeter running on X11, but possibly no more than that.,\n",
       "       It's not really that \"there is no a definite way to know which Image Version for Raspbian Jessie is installed\" but that the two images you're talking about, Raspbian PIXEL and Raspbian Lite, are the same OS with different sets of packages installed. Either one can, in theory, be turned into the other by adding and/or removing packages; in practice people quickly do system updates and perhaps add their own packages to produce a system that is then neither of the original two images, exactly.The question of whether a system \"has a GUI\" is about as ill-defined. A system may not have an X11 server on it (and thus not be able to render a local graphical display, e.g., via the HDMI port) but still have graphical programs that can be displayed on a remote X11 server being used by someone logged in over the network. Or a system might have an X11 server but not have the desktop software installed to actually display a desktop of the sort one normally considers to be \"the GUI.\" Or perhaps it doesn't have the standard Raspbian LXDE or PIXEL desktop software available, but does have a completely different set of desktop software such as Xfce or Gnome.What you need to do is figure out quite precisely what you want to do and what other software you need to do that and then ensure that other software on which you depend is installed. Typically this is done by making your software a package and, when you create that package, stating the other packages on which it depends. This will cause the dependencies to be installed automatically when your package is installed.

       "       The problem is that you want to connect 2 devices of the same type. But it's still possible. You can use a Crossover cable for this (Method 1), or you could use a switch or hub to automatic make a crossover connection (Method 2). Or just use a simple router (Method 3).Make a connection possibleMethod1:Use a Crossover cable and connect your PC and PI:An Ethernet crossover cable is a type of Ethernet cable used to connect computing devices together directly. Normal straight through or patch cables were used to connect from a host network interface controller (a computer or similar device) to a network switch, hub or router. A cable with connections that \"cross over\" was used to connect two devices of the same type: two hosts or two switches to each other. Owing to the inclusion of Auto-MDIX capability.You need to connect the cables in the UTP cable like this: http://www.incentre.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/ethcablerj45cr.gifSource: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cableMethod2:You also can use a modern twisted pair Ethernet cable to connect to your PI. But you need a hub or switch for this:connections can be made with a straight-through cable by means of an MDI-X port, also known as an \"internal crossover\" or \"embedded crossover\" connection. Hub and switch ports with such internal crossovers are usually labelled as such, with \"uplink\" or \"X\". For example, 3Com usually labels their ports 1X, 2X, and so on. In some cases a button is provided to allow a port to act as either a normal or an uplink port.Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_over_twisted_pairMore information:Introduced in 1998, this made the distinction between uplink and normal ports and manual selector switches on older hubs and switches obsolete. If one or both of two connected devices has the automatic MDI/MDI-X configuration feature there is no need for crossover cables. Although Auto-MDIX was specified as an optional feature in the 1000BASE-T standard, in practice it is implemented widely on most interfaces. Besides the eventually agreed upon Automatic MDI/MDI-X, this feature may also be referred to by various vendor-specific terms including: Auto uplink and trade, Universal Cable Recognition and Auto Sensing.Source: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet_crossover_cableMethod 3Use a Router and connect both the PI and PC to the Router.Make the connectionGive them both an IP in the same range, for example:PC: 192.168.1.10 Subnet: 255.255.255.0PI: 192.168.1.11 Subnet: 255.255.255.0You can find here how to do this: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-configure-a-static-ip-address-tutorial/Enable SSHhttp://steve.dynedge.co.uk/2012/05/29/enabling-ssh-on-debian-raspberry-pi/Connect to the PIOn Windows use for example Putty.Other method:You also can look here: http://www.linux-usb.org/usbnet/,\n",

       "       I'm afraid this is most likely impractical. My (crude and thoroughly incomplete) understanding is that the Pi's camera module (which uses an OmniVision OV5647 sensor) is very closely tied to the camera firmware on the GPU. The camera's own ISP is largely ignored and the GPU itself performs the majority of post-processing (de-mosaic, AWB, AGC, etc). In this forum post jbeale (who knows a good deal more about these things than I do) goes into some of the complexities one would face in trying to make an interface-compatible camera:      plugwash wrote:What is stopping someone making an interface-compatible clone of the chip?      Well... google for a preliminary datasheet for the R-Pi camera sensor \"ov5647_full.pdf\" (confidential, but nevertheless leaked online) and note the hundreds of control registers, many described in a few words only. Even the R-Pi foundation who have a current data sheet under NDA report it does not describe the chip well enough to use it, much less re-create it. The R-Pi implementation relies on specific register parameter sets they got direct from OmniVision. I assume the incomplete documentation is a deliberate strategy to prevent the very thing you suggest (as well as the fact that writing good accurate complete documentation takes a lot of time).    I presume you could reverse engineer a chip that worked in one specific application based on specific settings, but the device is so configurable, it would not be a general-purpose replacement, hence not marketable enough to make it worth the considerable effort. At least, that is my guess.Might be worth reading the rest of that thread as well; it's about the cheap knock-offs of the official Pi camera module. What's interesting to note is that every single one uses the same sensor and just varies the PCB layout and/or lenses which hints that doing anything else is simply not economic (even assuming it's practical), so whilst it might make an academically interesting exercise (again, assuming it's practical) it would almost certainly be cheaper to just buy some camera modules given the equipment you'd need to perform the reverse engineering.To give some idea of the equipment and complexities involved, here's a couple more forum posts with detail of reverse engineering work done on the Pi's own camera module:Frame synchronizationLow level interfacing to OV5647So, in conclusion, it might be an interesting project but I'm afraid the likelihood of coming up with something operational at the end of it is extremely small.,\n",

But we are in a brave new era with the need for new things, just like running 12+ Pi's without using separate HUBS for power.First it is essential to understand what a a USB cable is made up of. Thanks to Wikipedia for the image, please consider donating to them.What you are interested in is the +5V and GND lines in the USB cables. You can get a seperate (best use a regulated 5A/10A/15A power supply)   Regulated is great because the power is cleaner and stable- so the  more things you put, well, NO voltage drop basically. It stays 5V from 0% to 95%  (or 99% on better PSU's) load! Cheap USB PSU's Voltage drops on higher loads.You determine how many amps you need by adding up the total amps of the devices connected, more or less, but this is layman's terms. You really need to read the specification and check the operating wattage because this is after spin up, and spin up wattage will also be rated and some models how efficiency mode too. Using OHM's law its easy to calcualte.   I(Current, AMPS) * V (Voltage) = P (Power, WATTS) So a 5A regualted power supply will be happy to provide you with 25WATTS of continuous power at ~95%, allowing peak overload currents (connecting devices, spin ups, initial start, etc) without Voltage drops!The solution requires DIYAnd in your case allot of it! Chopping into the USB cable, cutting the RED +5V and stripping the BLACK GND. You don't want to back feed the Pi's (But you could power the Pi's like this too! But that is another way) It is essential the GND stays connected as GND is used to filter out noise. As pictured in these steps, 1,2,3. LEFT THE PI, RIGHT THE HDD, BOTTOM THE POWER SUPPLYIt is also important to keep the DATA LINES shielded as much as possible, as noise will degrade or completely kill communications, so don't cut away the shield, cut into the shield, avoid cutting or nicking the data lines too! Then connect the wires and re shield the original cable, leaving on only the +5V and GND sticking out.This can be made easier by making a PCB board, it requires no complicated IC's, just some protection and shielding. I could make and assemble these pretty cheaply but anybody with experience can do it. This could be further expanded with USB HUB IC's, where 1 Pi connects to the board and provides powered USB to 3 more device, it increases the cost slightly but you could create a massive array of transparently powered USB hubs! Then you just need to find a cheap provider of USB cables :) ,\n",

A Raspberry Pi is a proper computer (as in: it has a processor and a GPU, memory, input and output connectors) which, just like your Windows and Ubuntu machines, needs an Operating System to do anything at all. That OS can be simple or complex, but most OSes available have a default GUI for you to work with (but can be configured to give you a text-based login as well). Then, once you have an OS up and running, the RPi allows you to connect to external hardware using the GPIO, for which it has a range of tools available (RPI.GPIO is just one example for when you'd like to program using Python). This is where the RPi differs from a normal computer - the availability of GPIO pins (combined with 5V, 3V3 and GND) to interact with external devices.If you want a device to which you just upload some code and it interacts with external hardware, you might want to look at Arduino (and its clones), this type of device has a microcontroller (not a microprocessor, though the difference is sort of theoretical) on it which does not need an operating system to function.

       "       DOCUMENTATION > CONFIGURATION > WIRELESS > WIRELESS-CLISETTING WIFI UP VIA THE COMMAND LINEThis method is suitable if you don't have access to the graphical user interface normally used to set up WiFi on the Raspberry Pi. It is particularly suitable for use with a serial console cable if you don't have access to a screen or wired Ethernet network. Note also that no additional software is required; everything you need is already included on the Raspberry Pi.Getting WiFi network detailsTo scan for WiFi networks, use the command sudo iwlist wlan0 scan. This will list all available WiFi networks, along with other useful information. Look out for:'ESSID:\"testing\"' is the name of the WiFi network.'IE: IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 Version 1' is the authentication used. In this case it's WPA2, the newer and more secure wireless standard which replaces WPA. This guide should work for WPA or WPA2, but may not work for WPA2 enterprise. For WEP hex keys, see the last example here. You'll also need the password for the wireless network. For most home routers, this is found on a sticker on the back of the router. The ESSID (ssid) for the examples below is testing and the password (psk) is testingPassword.Adding the network details to the Raspberry PiOpen the wpa-supplicant configuration file in nano:sudo nano /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.confGo to the bottom of the file and add the following:network={    ssid=\"testing\"    psk=\"testingPassword\"}The password can be configured either as the ASCII representation, in quotes as per the example above, or as a pre-encrypted 32 byte hexadecimal number. You can use the wpa_passphrase utility to generate an encrypted PSK. This takes the SSID and the password, and generates the encrypted PSK. With the example from above, you can generate the PSK with wpa_passphrase \"testing\" \"testingPassword\". The output is as follows.network={      ssid=\"testing\"      #psk=\"testingPassword\"      psk=131e1e221f6e06e3911a2d11ff2fac9182665c004de85300f9cac208a6a80531  }Note that the plain text version of the code is present, but commented out. You should delete this line from the final wpa_supplicant file for extra security.The wpa_passphrase tool requires a password with between 8 and 63 characters. For more complex passphrases you can extract the content of a text file and use it as input for wpa_passphrase, if the password is stored as plain text inside a file somewhere, by calling wpa_passphrase \"testing\" &lt; file_where_password_is_stored. For extra security, you should delete the file_where_password_is_stored afterwards, so there is no plain text copy of the original password on the system.If you are using the wpa_passphrase encrypted PSK you can either copy and paste the encrypted PSK into the wpa_supplicant.conf file, or redirect the tools output to your configuration file by calling wpa_passphrase \"testing\" \"testingPassword\" >> /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf. Note that this requires you to change to root (by executing sudo su), or you can use wpa_passphrase \"testing\" \"testingPassword\" | sudo tee -a /etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf > /dev/null, which will append the passphrase without having to change to root. Both methods provide the necessary administrative privileges to change the file. Lastly, make sure you use >>, or use -a with tee, (both can be used to append text to an existing file) since >, or omitting -a when using tee, will erase all contents and then append the output to the specified file. Note that the redirection to /dev/null at the end of the second form simply prevents tee from also outputting to the screen (standard output).Now save the file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then finally press Enter.Reconfigure the interface with wpa_cli -i wlan0 reconfigure.You can verify whether it has successfully connected using ifconfig wlan0. If the inet addr field has an address beside it, the Raspberry Pi has connected to the network. If not, check that your password and ESSID are correct.Unsecured NetworksIf the network you are connecting to does not use a password, the wpa_supplicant entry for the network will need to include the correct key_mgmt entry. e.g.network={    ssid=\"testing\"    key_mgmt=NONE}Hidden NetworksIf you are using a hidden network, an extra option in the wpa_supplicant file, scan_ssid, may help connection.network={    ssid=\"yourHiddenSSID\"    scan_ssid=1    psk=\"Your_wifi_password\"}You can verify whether it has successfully connected using ifconfig wlan0. If the inet addr field has an address beside it, the Raspberry Pi has connected to the network. If not, check your password and ESSID are correct.Adding multiple wireless network configurationsOn recent versions of Raspbian, it is possible to set up multiple configurations for wireless networking. For example, you could set up one for home and one for school.For examplenetwork={    ssid=\"SchoolNetworkSSID\"    psk=\"passwordSchool\"    id_str=\"school\"}network={    ssid=\"HomeNetworkSSID\"    psk=\"passwordHome\"    id_str=\"home\"}If you have two networks in range, you can add the priority option to choose between them. The network in range, with the highest priority, will be the one that is connected.network={    ssid=\"HomeOneSSID\"    psk=\"passwordOne\"    priority=1    id_str=\"homeOne\"}network={    ssid=\"HomeTwoSSID\"    psk=\"passwordTwo\"    priority=2    id_str=\"homeTwo\"},\n",

Kernel timestamps (e.g. [    0.000000]) are in seconds (so have microsecond granularity); the date/clock timestamp is added by the rsyslog itself so will always be present whereas the kernel ones will only be for messages from the kernel itself (hence rsyslog's \"start\" message doesn't have one).Since that indicates the last boot, you are looking for the messages immediately before these two lines.  For a normal shutdown, the last one should be something like:Feb  9 22:32:32 localhost rsyslogd: [origin software=\"rsyslogd\" swVersion=\"8.10.0\" x-pid=\"11188\" x-info=\"http://www.rsyslog.com\"] exiting on signal 15.One problem with failures is that if they are sudden or involve some kind of crippling due to resource issues (out of RAM, hogged processor) the system may not have synced to disk and error messages will not have made it into the file.1.

Try the following steps, to get a very basic demo:Put Kivy on the Pi.

       "       Normal behaviour for a RPi3 during boot is to have a red LED on to indicate it has electrical power and tyo have a green LED on (right next tot he red LED) to indicate SD card activity. I suspect your SD card was not flashed properly. Follow the instructions here.,\n",
       "       I once flashed an SD card improperly (that sounds so wrong.) Anyway, I was trying to cross-compile a kernel for the Pi and I buggered it up, so the SD card would not boot. BUT, I did see the Rainbow screen of colours. And that's all I saw as it did not progress. So if the card is bootable, you should always see the Rainbow screen, which usually flashes up for a brief second at the start of boot up, but if the card won't boot, the Rainbow remains on the screen till you turn the RPi off.Now I just did a quick couple of experiments:Experiment #1:  I booted up my RPi3 with no SD card in it. I got a black screen and nothing more.Experiment #2:  I booted up my RPi3 with an SD card that had a RPi1 kernel on it.  That displayed the Rainbow screen and was stuck on the Rainbow screen.The red LED comes on in both cases. I think I saw the green LED flicker for experiment #2.So double-check that your SD card is inserted correctly (e.g. the correct way up.) Insert your SD card into your PC and confirm it looks ok in a file manager. Try another SD card, preferably one that you know boots on a RPi 3 (e.g. one from a mate?),\n",

       "       This is not a direct answer in the sense of \"here I wrote a script for you\" but it does contain some information that might be helpful to you or someone else who wants to do so.You can probably automate fdisk via a tool called expect, which is intended to be used in scripts with interactive CLI tools; the basic idea is you tell expect what prompt to expect and what answer to provide using an \"expect script\".  It isn't installed by default most places, and depends on Tcl, which may also not be installed, so you could just do that and have a look at it and play around, or have a look at the man page online (e.g.) and whatever tutorials and examples you can find (remember, search \"linux expect tutorial\", do not include \"raspberry pi\" in your search terms).[Regarding OSMC: I'm not sure OSMC is intended to provide things like this, so you should check that first and if expect isn't available, keep reading, because it is more likely to have sfdisk, which is a better option anyway; if that isn't available give, you are out of luck.]Using expect is not the ideal answer here, however.  The better option is a tool called sfdisk which is sort of like fdisk, but intended for scripting using its own format.  This can be fed via stdin, so you could do it with a \"here document\" in a bash script.A thing about partition tables is you can screw around with them without destroying any data as long as you don't actually mount and use any of the partitions.  The partition table information is written to a part of the device that is separate from the partitions themselves, so you can completely change things, then put it back the way it was -- no harm done.  I'm saying this because you could get comfortable with sfdisk by reading the man page and playing around with a spare USB stick (if available).  The first thing you'll want to do is make a back-up copy of the existing table that sfdisk can then use to restore things later; see the -d option.Sfdisk is probably installed by default; try man sfdisk to find out. You want to read that page anyway.There is a newer version of sfdisk (2.26, from 2015) that has a much better man page (and some additional functionality for GPT disks, but that is irrelevant on the pi).  Unfortunately, Raspbian and other Debian derived distros (I think this includes OSMC) are still using a version from 2011.  I would guess it is otherwise much the same but the man page is not as friendly.  The ones found online are mostly for this old version as well.   :( The newer one has a whole section \"BACKING UP THE PARTITION TABLE\" based on using sfdisk -d /dev/whatever &gt; backup.fileThat you can later use to restore it if need be using:sfdisk /dev/whatever &lt; backup.fileThis should be applicable to the old version, just it is not spelled out in the man page.  Note I do not know how agreeable sfdisk is to making changes to a mounted partition containing the root filesystem but if you can do it with fdisk you can probably do it with sfdisk, and it can't hurt to try (unless it actually works and you screw up, lol).I said earlier that you can do this without harming anything as long as you don't mount and access the partitions but that is not quite true: It's as long as you don't change anything.  So you could mount them read-only, or just check it and don't change anything.  In the case of expanding a filesystem, this means:Using sfdisk to script expanding the partition.Mounting the partition to check the filesystem is still readable. It won't have changed size; to do that you still have to use resizefs as per the link in your question (s/fdisk just increases the size of the partition so there is room for a bigger filesystem), but you want to make sure it is still readable because you want the starting offset the same.  Otherwise I think using resizefs will fail and/or wreck the data on the fs.  You could try to do this by just sticking/keeping it in the pi and seeing if it works but I advise against that unless you are determined to do all this from the pi itself, in which case I'd still look around for that old USB stick to play with first.  And remember, if it doesn't work, you are now stuck having to take the card out and fix it elsewhere anyway.Using resizefs to expand the filesystem on the partition.  If you are trying to do this on a running pi several reboots are needed so you can't really do it with one simple script.  You could do it with one more complicated script set up to fly via init as per raspi-config; if you think you are up to that, have a look at how that is done ;)That's all you need to know to write a script to resize a filesystem.  IMO very few people really need to do that, and the ones that do should have the ability to read and make use of this information.  If it seems beyond your current skills, you probably do not need to be doing this in the first place.Note that new versions of Raspbian look to have a new GUI tool for expanding the root fs, but of course you are not using Raspbian.,\n",
       "       I am not familiar with the latest OSMC (I run Kodi under Raspbian) but AFAIK it has a simple 2 partition FS and has the normal Linux tools.If so the following should work:-To resize:-run sudo fdisk /dev/mmcblk0Then press the keys in order:**d 2** to delete,**n p 2 Enter Enter** to re-create.Verify the prompts to make sure what you are entering is sensible.In particular make sure the same starting sector as the one you just deleted.Reboot and enter:-sudo resize2fs /dev/mmcblk0p2You could make a script BUT scripting fdisk is far from straightforward and you will probably never need to repeat. ,\n",

The only avenue left for you is to read from the buffer really really often.I'm not sure what size the hardware buffer is - but assuming 8 bytes, you'll need to be polling it at minimum of 115200/8 = 14400Hz.I don't think the scheduler will give you a guarantee of a slice every 70 microseconds,\n",

       "       The vulnerability described in that article sounds like a complete and total disaster that Apple should be hussling to fix ASAP.However, it obviously won't work on GNU/Linux including Raspbian.  With regard to resembling the issue of the default privileges given to Raspbian's pi user, I'll point out two very significant differences:The pi user in /etc/sudoers is a matter of intentional configuration, which can easily be changed in minutes.  In contrast, an unintentional bug of the sort involved with DYLD_PRINT_TO_FILE cannot be changed by the user, period.  If you own an OSX system with this problem, there is absolutely nothing you can do to protect yourself from it whether you know about it or not.  The system requires a linker.Going back to what \"intentional\" means: It is explicit.  If you understand how the system works, then you will recognize it is possible for a user with the pi password to execute total FUBAR commands.  This is not a mistake or a secret.  It's right out in the open from the beginning.For me, #1 is the primary point.  If you don't like this kind of set-up (I don't) then change it.  This could be as simple as deleting user pi, or even more simply, just changing pi's password after you install.  Most people presumably will do that (unless they don't think any one else can gain access to the system) out of plain common sense.  This is the online, digital information age after all. If I sold you a computer and said, \"The admin user is 'admin' and the password is 'FUBAR', just as it is originally for all computers of this type,\" you'd probably ponder that a little (\"Hmm, so if someone else who owned one of these knew this they might try to see if I'm still using the default password...\").  This is the norm for household routers, I think.People who are completely computer illiterate, do not understand the significance of passwords, etc. are really unlikely to want an Rpi, and if they do, there is probably a lot more grief waiting.1Again, I don't mean by this that I feel it is a good practice and will not guess as to why Raspbian, decided to do this (normal Debian does not); perhaps because they felt it made a potentially intimidating process less prone to stress and error.  Which I'm sure it does.  However, it is also a good example of how things can be dumbed down to the point of potential calamity.1. Which raises a question about user-friendliness, etc.  On this front I'd make a point about GNU/Linux that I think many people used to purely commercial software may miss because the meaning of it may be sort of incomprehensible to them: No one sold it to you, and probably no one responsible for it even asked you to use it; Raspbian is a bit gray in this but it is still the case.  Even if you bought a card with Raspbian installed, what you were paying for was not Raspbian, it was the card, and having someone burn it. I'm pointing this out because it is then worth asking who is it that produces such software and why.  Was it you? If not, was it to please you?  Perhaps not.  Hence, beware that this is not a normal consumer pays corporation relationship.  You are responsible for yourself here, and nobody owes you anything.,\n",
       "         How likely is it that there will be an problem?If the system is idle, most likely it won't be a problem.  An unclean power-off is like rolling dice -- snake eyes and you lose.  But most of the time you won't.  So if you are asking, \"Is there a way I can guarantee this is okay?\", the answer is no (but see the final paragraph, below).  If you are asking \"Is this worth the risk?\" when it sounds like you don't have a choice, the answer is if you don't have a choice then it is a risk you will have to take.In ideal terms, I do not believe the pi is any more prone to corrupting a filesystem when the power is cut than a normal computer, and the same factors apply: If the system is very busy at the time, the chance of corruption is greater.  I say \"in ideal terms\" because I think if some of the power problems associated with the pi contribute to corruption, then the story may get a little different.  The solution to that presuming there's not also some quality control issue, is to use a proper power supply.I have not done a formal survey, but I think reports of problematic corruption have diminished a bit this year.  There's then this issue to consider, which I have not investigated further.  It's no longer an issue and may never have been (but it may also have been very significant).Note that the kernel bug issue doesn't depend on cutting the power and the insufficient power/possibly defective hardware issue probably doesn't either, meaning that might have been coincidentally blamed in a lot of the cases online. You might be interested in this recent answer from someone who claims to be involved with some decent scale commercial application where they cut the power all the time and have not had any problems.  This hints at the fact that people who don't have a problem will not post a Q&amp;A online, \"Everything worked fine again today: Why?\".If feasible, using read-only filesystems should (again: in \"ideal terms\"1) eliminate the risk.  But this may be another thing about which you don't have a choice.1. We've had at least a few people here report corruption when killing the power even with a read-only filesystem, which should not happen.  This implies a hardware or software defect, as outlined above, is responsible in some cases, which will probably never affect most people.,\n",

Then connect the regulator's Vout to one of the wires of the fan and the other wire to GND.As you point out, you could use a breadboard, and a MB102 Power supply, as these have onboard regulators, and both 5V and 3.3V pins. Here is a photo of mine (ignore the optocouplers and the LCD displays):If used in conjunction with a breadboard, that would be a perfect solution. They are reasonably priced. Then you can just poke the wires from the fans into the breadboard holes, and no soldering is required.Using GPIOConnect the bare copper wires to the 3.3V and the GND pins (Pins 1 and 6 respectively for both a RPi 1 and RPi 2). The answer to this question, Plug a 5V fan to GPIO 1 and 2, may also help you.  NOTE: Do NOT connect the fans to the IO pins of the GPIO port, as they  can supply only a very limited current and you will end up frying  your RPiThe current available, via the GPIO Power pins, is stated here, on GPIO +5v max current?  According to the schematic there is a 1A fuse and from what others  have said the Raspberry Pi uses about 700mA so 200mA is what your left  with to use for USB and anything over the +5v GPIO pin.     So yes you could use it on the +5v GPIO pin but then there would be  nothing left for the USB.     Also because it is so close to the fuse limit any slight change could  cause the fuse to engage.See also the answers to the question How do I supply power through the GPIO?Either way, you should make sure that your PSU to the RPi can supply sufficient current. Any PSU capable of 2 to 3 Amps would be good. Unfortunately, the specifications of the fans do not state their current draw, so it is better to plan for more current draw than less, else the RPi may end up behaving erratically and/or crash, see RPI 2 B freezes when Wi-Fi dongle is inserted and doesn't detect it.You can measure the current draw by using a USB voltmeter between the RPi and the fans. These are available on eBay for a couple of dollars.,\n",
       "       It is not recommended to run a bare DC fan directly from GPIO port power pins.The DC fans/motors emit back EMF that could induce hundreds (or even thousands depending on inductance) of transient volts back into the power supply. If the power supply output is not protected, the power supply will be damaged.You can use a DC fan if a proper back-EMF protection circuit (example: TVS) is applied between the GPIO Raspberry Pi power pins and the DC fan. It is better to power the fan from another wall wart or a hub.For a 3.3v Fan you can take power from Raspberry Pi USB port and convert the voltage to 3.3v using a small 3 pin VRM like this:What is back-emf: counter-electromotive force?,\n",

Having the Pi hooked up directly to a router next to my PC it would work perfectly. But as soon as I installed the cam where I wanted it, and tried to access the stream with two routers between, no image would arrive. I checked the source-code and found the TTL set to maximum. I never figured it out completely.Currently I would recommend RaspberryIPCamera wich has a nice user interface (see screenshots) and there even is a ready-made SD-card image for it. I have tried the SD-card, but reverted to doing a manual install as described here with great success (my current setup). Instructions for hooking it up to a Synology DiskStation are also available and are working perfectly on my system.

Results showed that the data pin had huge constant 1kHz noise on the data pin. Module is receiving data on much lower frequency than the noise. (300Hz-400Hz)So i assume it picks up noise from pi gpio or something. I also made a low pass with 700 Hz cut off and this works ok but i had no luck gaining the distance. The data comes to the receiver between 300-400 Hz frequency. Hard to tell the exact frequency. I tried to make a bandbass filter but the high pass side seems not letting the data through with 20 Hz cutoff.Theres an article on the internet which talks about module for Pi which is basically filter module for RF projects.

THE LED.When i connected green LED with a 100 Ohm resistor to the data pin the led is constantly glowing. Its not bright but you see small green light. On this occasion the receiver did not receive nothing. So is was pure constant noise.Next step was to start messing with Low pass filter. I connected 240Ohm resistor and 1.5 uF cap as low pass between data pin and ground. So i connected the greed LED to filtered voltage and the constant noise were filtered. Led is blinking by the data signals only when the transmitter sends something to the receiver.Also, my baudrate in the transmitter and receiver code was a bit high.

       "       The GUI stack on GNU/Linux usually requires (at least) two drivers, one used by the kernel, and a userspace one for the X server.  I think the latter one tends to be more generic, which is perhaps why there's no indication of one being installed; the kernel one handles the specifics so that a more generic, pre-installed driver can be used with X (in contrast, another question about a touchscreen here yesterday seemed to involve a generic and/or preinstalled kernel driver, but a custom X driver).The X server does not require a configuration, in which case it probes the hardware and tries to makes an appropriate decision.  However, if you do provide a configuration, it will stick to that.  If that configuration is wrong, it will fail.X logs various things at start up to /var/log/Xorg.0.log.  It is tidy about this and rolls them over, so that log contains only information from the most recent start (hence you will also find a .1.log and so on, these are for previous initializations).

Many registrars provide DNS services for free.  There are also some free third-party DNS servers, although in this you get what you pay for.  There are a variety of high-quality, low cost dns hosting companies that you could investigate.  You could of course also run your own nameservers (using bind or some other dns software), but as you have noticed most registrars want you to have more than a single nameserver.  You could work out an arrangement with a friend to cross-host your domains, If you want to host a website, you need to install and configure a webserver, and it sounds like you've already got that working.So other than getting some nameservers provisioned you're all set.To \"host email for your domain\":You need (well, should) establish MX records in DNS that indicate what servers are responsible for handling mail for your domain.  You can actually get away without this if your domain has an A record, but it's good form (and offers you flexibility you wouldn't otherwise have).  The MX record points to a hostname which must also be available in DNS.On the host pointed to by your MX record, you need to run some sort of \"MTA\" (mail transfer agent), like Postfix or Sendmail or Exim or something.  I use Postfix.If you want to be able to access email via POP or IMAP (as opposed to simply forwarding it elsewhere), you would also need to install something like Dovecot or Courier or Cyrus IMAPD to provide the POP/IMAP service.If you're concerned about security, you'll want to configure all of your email-related services to support SSL, and you'll want your MTA to require authentication for outbound email (if you plan on using it for outbound mail).For what it's worth: while I host my own MX server, I don't actually receive any email there -- it just forwards mail to other accounts (mostly Gmail these days, but also elsewhere).There's lots of good documentation there on how to set things up.

His methods will give you the longest battery life running off of regular batteries, but his methods also void the warranty...Laptop batteries usually have a small chip installed to measure different battery statistics (battery life being one of them).  Laptops then access the information from this chip and print out the information to the user when requested.  If you run your Raspberry Pi off of standard consumer batteries (which don't have a chip to my knowledge), you can't calculate the information as easily.I don't believe any software has been developed yet to calculate battery power for the Raspberry Pi.  Because there is no \"standard\" way of providing portable power, OS developers cannot implement it; there may be software that some people have developed for their specific way of supplying power to the Raspberry Pi, but it is doubtful that it would be released.,\n",

       "       It depends on what you want! NOOBS is the all around favorite and most suggested for beginners, as it is simple and makes the setup of the Raspberry Pi very easy.

However, NOOBS is simply the way to install the OS', it isn't an OS in and of itself.To help choose the OS:If you are going for a full fledged, easy-to-set-up distribution, I would use Raspbian, as crazyskeggy suggested. It is the suggested OS for beginners, as it comes pre-installed with many packages that are useful, and it is easy to set up and control. Raspbian is based off Debian, a popular Linux distribution. Raspberry Pi Fedora Remix, AKA Pidora, is also another beginner-ish OS, though it is different than Raspbian.However, if you want a fast, in control of everything and anything from the beginning, I would use Arch. Word of Warning, Arch isn't for the average beginner user, as you have to download and install everything, as Arch starts after installation and plops you down in front of a command line with limited packages. You have to install all of the X packages and most non-essential programs. While this gives you control over your system at a very low level, it makes it a very non-beginner-friendly option.If you want something different, RISC OS is something to look at. It behaves quite a bit different than either Raspbian and Pidora and was originally created for the Archimedes computers created by Acorn that ran on ARM CPUs. It is actually quite old, being introduced in 1987, though many people still like to use it on the Raspberry Pi.Finally, if you are going for a Home Theater PC, there are three options: XBMC, Raspbmc, and OpenELEC. Only Raspbmc and OpenELEC are featured on the Raspberry Pi downloads page, though you can find the download for XBMC simply by googling around.,\n",

I'm guessing you've figured out your complexities for emailing from the command line and so I won't go into detail on that, as it would take ages, with configuring postfix and all that shtuffs. You obviously need to have mail or whatever you use to email set up, and then email yourself the $body variable.You could configure a cron job to run this, say, every day or so, or whenever the Pi boots up, or whenever.Then, you can check that email and grab the Pi's IP, and SSH in.

       "       I'd agree with Ghanima's comment that Raspbian is as sensible an option as any. The magic word for your application is 'kiosk'. There's no shortage of existing projects to poach from.

Mainstream HTTP servers such as apache, nginx, and node.js are capable and available.

       "       I would start over. If you have started making or building files and directories and moving things or deleting things you are going to spend a lot of time trying to fix things that never should have been messed with. Burn Raspbian or NOOBS from Raspberrypi.org according to the instructions given on the downloads page. After you reinstall do not make,remove, or delete files and folders before you check simple things like spelling, punctuation and spacing as you type them in the terminal. Make sure you use sudo or have permission to do what are trying to do.  You stated you did not think you had a boot folder, and also you made a boot folder to create a config.txt file. I will tell you this..you may have deleted, moved or renamed it but at one time you did. I personally do NOT mess around with folders like boot without caution and backing up my system. I would suggest you spend some time learning the file tree, how it works and what the files and folders are used for. Raspberry pi is very forgiving. You can mess up and just burn a new image to reinstall and keep going a million times. By taking time to learn about your system and how it works you wont need to reinstall a million times.This is not the answer you are looking for, but they way you asked the question and what you are asking for I believe this is the answer you need. There may be a series of commands that could potentially save the day and undo what has been done, but if you are just planning on typing in commands that you never understand you will always have problems.

Additional protections should be considered if you feed through GPIO.Basically to answer you question, you can use the Peukert's Law as a first approximation:C = t*I^kWhere k is an adimensional constant ranging in [1.1;1.3] depending of the battery, I is the current drawn (you need to sum all components of your circuit, including your GPS. RPi draws 1A when idle), C the battery capacity (the fundamental specification of the battery with a dimension in A.s) and t the discharge time.Eg.: t = 1/2h, I = 2000mA and k=1.2 leads to C = 0.5*2000^1.2 = 4573 mAh, then you better to select a 4800mAh battery.Battery voltage must be chosen accordingly with the voltage regulator you selected. Do not forget that you need a good 5V supply in order to service your RPi.Caution: LiH battery needs to be handle with care, it may explode and cause injuries.

       "       First of all, remember that software for RaspberryPi is in early state of development and there are a lot of problems with it. They are worked on all the time but still, it's not yet as polished as it could be. Currently RaspberryPi is more oriented to developers than to normal users. It was never designed to be media center it just happens to be possible to use it like that. So a lot of people are running raspberrypi as media center with success. However here are a couple of glitches you may encounter:The CPU of RaspberryPi is quite low-end and it can't really decode video at decent speed (even SD MPEG2). Hardware acceleration has to be used but by default only H264 can be hardware accelerated. You can buy a licence key to enable additional hardware decoders from RPi foundation (currently you can buy MPEG2 and VC-1 license). Graphics chip on RaspberryPi is VERY powerful and if video is encoded with a format supported by the hardware decoder, it can easily play HD content 1080p. But you will have to transcode all your material that is in different formats. And hardware decoding only works with dedicated video player (omxplayer). It is used by RaspBMC so if you plan on using this solution, you should have no problem. If you are planning on running your own distribution, you have to integrate omxplayer. Also bear in mind that omxplayer is quite young project and while it's quite stable, it's not perfect (like most things on RPi dedicated software). Normal graphical environment (X server) does not use accelerated graphics. This is why you found some informations about slow GUI rendering. AFAIK XBMC is using OpenGL ES which does use hardware acceleration so it's not a problem if you plan on using it. There are some problems with sound as it's drivers are not good quality right now. You may hear some glitches in audio. There are also problems with USB on Rpi, this wont let you use USB card to make audio problems go away. And since network chip is also connected using USB, there may be some glitches. Most of them are addressed right now in new versions of software but there may be some more. Because of the way USB on RaspberryPi was designed and because of the drivers issues, there may be problems with some USB keyboards or other remote contollers. You may need to use good active hub to connect USB devices. Especially if you are planning on using Wifi.Most of the issues mentioned above will be invalid after some time as it will probably be fixed. But this may take some time to get there.To sum up - you asked if it's powerful enough. I believe it's not a good question because it's not really power issue here. Hardware is powerful enough (if you can transcode everything to h264) but software is not mature enough and has some glitches. It may not be simple enough to get it working without problem and this is what you are looking for.So my suggestion is - if you plan on learning something about Linux, embedded devices, multimedia etc and are willing to spend some time reading about that and experimenting and having working multimedia device is only a bonus, Raspberrypi will be good choice. if all you need is multimedia player, buy something else, some finished product designed for this purpose.,\n",

Setup was as easy as downloading the .img file from xbian.org and then writing it to SD card via Win32DiskImager. All I did after that was hook it to my TV with HDMI, plugged in the SD card and then the power adapter and voila...instant media center.It had no issues whatsoever finding files from my three networked computers and was capable of playing high quality 720p video over the network (wired, not wireless) without any glitches whatsoever, No lagging and no other issues. I have yet to try any 1080p content but that's my next step.On a side note? After hooking up the the RPi via HDMI I was able to use my TV remote to navigate through menu's, I didn't have to change any settings...it just did it out of the box but your mileage may vary. :)Hope this helped,\n",
       "       This thread is a little old, but figured I'd give my 2 cents anyways.Like Stu, I'm using XBian on my Pi and have a few different computers networked to it. So far I'm not having any issues. I use network shares from my main computer, and my roommates, to watch videos in the living room. Over a network cable I have not seen any lag. I don't have a WiFi dongle to test out the wireless, but my wireless sucks anyways. There are only a couple of places where I can say I have experienced \"lag\". When trying to access the menu during playback it takes 3-4 seconds before it displays, but that's trivial in my opinion. Also, after closing the menu while the video was still playing in the background, I have noticed a slight increase in the playback speed as if it were trying to catch up, but that might just have been because of the amount of time I had spent in the menu while troubleshooting a sound issue. In case you are curious, I had it plugged into the wrong input and then not plugged in at all. Spent an hour trying to figure that out.Besides that, everything runs very smooth. Menu transitions are fluid, even during playback. Audio and Video sync up. Setup is pretty much nill. I had to adjust my screen alignment, but I am also using an older TV. The only problem I am faced with now is DVD playback and figuring out how to get the samba \"shortcuts\" to the proper sections, if that is even possible. All-in-all, I think this was a wonderful investment that beats my prior investment in a PS3, that I don't really use anymore, hands down.Besides, it has so much potential! I can't wait to start pushing this puppy to the max!,\n",

I can only assume this is due to the Raspberry Pi not being able to allocate enough memory to the 'buffer'.Increasing the cache in xbmc advanced settings made a big improvement, but it still not 'as good'.However when streaming media off attached storage, i.e. the SD card or a USB drive for media, I noticed no different at all in performance.,\n",

That man page doesn't explain it but the setting is always of the form widthxheight+horizontal+vertical, e.g., 5x10+50+25 but you can leave the w x h out, e.g., just +50+25. It's in pixels, so will take a few minutes playing around.I wrote \"ostensibly\" because the window manager could screw with it -- that's what's adding those decorations.  But probably not. There may be a way to tell LXDE to not used them for xeyes in particular, I dunno.  As mentioned, I'd check and see if openbox is in use (ls -A | grep openbox) and investigate that.Once you get the geometry worked out you can actually include it in a config file called /etc/X11/Xresources (I think this still exists by default), add something like:xeyes*geometry +100+50If it doesn't work source it from your .xinit or similar.

You need a voltage regulator to take this voltage and make it a solid 5 Volts.  This article has instructions for creating a battery pack from 6 AA batteries and some off the shelf parts.,\n",
       "       The joy of electronics questions like this is one of the reasons I love the Pi. Unfortunately wall chargers pretty much everywhere in the world work on AC current, which they turn into DC current that powers the Pi. One letter difference how had can it be? Well, alternating vs. direct as it turns out matters somewhat.In alternating current, the electrons in the wire bump back and forth, back and forth in the same position. Each electron knocking its neighbour and vice-versa is what carries the power. The fact the electronics essentially never move is what makes it great for transmission over long distances, like from the power plant to your house. However, because the electrons go back and forth, trying to power a car with an AC engine would be like watching it go forwards and backwards repeatedly. (Not to say that you can't power a car with an AC engine, but I'm using it as a metaphor here.)In direct current, the electrons travel the full distance. This makes the car with that same motor move in one direction only. If we move the car metaphor, where powering of an AC motor is actually trivial, to most consumer electronics, powering them with AC is non-trivial. Hence DC. Why not use DC for everything? The fact that all the electrons are moving means the experience resistance (think friction) which causes them to heat up (hot wires) which further increases resistance (you slow down on a hot day) which means you have to put more power in. In room temperatures it's a loosing proposition. (In near absolute zero conditions it works amazingly well---that's where the super conductors of fabled sci-fi enter in.)Anyway, the difference between AC and DC is why using the wall wort from DC power won't work. They use clever bits of electronics (previously transformers, now switched mode regulators) to make the transition. But there are such things DC to DC convertors. Switched mode regulators do that too. The MoPi board has one, will take any input voltage from around 8 to 25 V (so basically as many AAs as you can find, or any whacky old laptop battery) and make it so that the Pi can use it. It will then also tell you when the battery is about dead. Nifty!,\n",

The messages are normally reported to standard error.And finally:   -v   --verbose       Turn on verbose output, with all the available data.  The default output is verbose.Which seems redundant since that's the default, but sometimes I am dubious with wget (and why would they have a switch to turn on a default feature?).There is also -d if you still aren't getting anything in /tmp/wget.log.  Beware that /tmp is a volatile directory in RAM on most systems, so if you turn the pi on and off you will lose that information.,\n",

       "       You really should fix your Internet Connection Sharing on your Windows computer.  Once that's working, then you'll fall in love with your Raspberry Pi again ;-)In the mean time, you could investigate the apt-offline package (assuming you're using a Debian based Pi distro).  It allows you to download packages to an USB stick for installing on an offline linux computer.  As it's a Python based application, then it works in Windows too.Instructions for use are available here.  Although they are Linux based, you should be able to adapt them to work on Windows.,\n",
       "       Installers work using packages on many Linux systems - Debian (Raspbian) uses .deb packages. So you can download the packages you need to install on your Pi, transfer them to the Pi and install them.For instance, instead of running sudo apt-get install iceweasel (to install the Debian version of Firefox), you can:First, go to to https://www.debian.org/distrib/packages and use the search tool to find the package you need (e.g. iceweasel) - there is also a full (and very large) listing of the packages here.You can then download the .deb package  - you will need to download the arm package linked at the bottom of the page (using the armhf packages should work, armel might). Packages for other architectures won't work.Once on the Pi, you can install the package(s) by running  sudo dpkg -i /path/to/file/.deb /path/to/other/file.debIf you end up with dependency problems (extra packages are needed package you are installing to work), you should be able download those off of the Debian packages site as well. These dependency packages are listed on the package's page - e.g. for iceweasel, it says you need xulrunnerEdit: just remembered another way would be to get apt on the Pi to give you the URLs of the files it needs instead of attempting to download the packages - so you would run the apt install command, but with --print-uris added in:sudo apt-get --print-uris install PROGRAMYou can download the files from the URLs it gives on the Windows machine. The advantage of this is that it only prompts for the download of things it needs, and does required guessing as in my above answer.I did an answer on this a while back here - it has some sample output and stuff.,\n",

You might able to get around this by making sure the script has a line reading . /lib/lsb/init-functions somewhere near the top.

That way you could have the Pi turn a pin on and off to turn that part of the external circuit on and off.In other words, you want to create your own circuit/device, that you can control through the GPIO pins, and try not to have your external circuit share a power source with your piHere's an introduction to transistorshttp://www.technologystudent.com/elec1/transis1.htmI would not recommend using the GPIO pins as a power source for things like motors, or directly hooking up power sources to the GPIO pins, as doing those things could deprive the Pi of power, or damage it. (LED lights are an exception I guess as they consume a tiny amount of power compared to motors),\n",
       "       Just for clarification on Alex's answerFor just a single LED, the RPi's GPIO pins would work fine. However, for a larger appliance such as a motor, you will need an external power source to give it the necessary power. To incorporate an external power source, create a circuit with a transistor in it. Attach one of the GPIO pins to the transistor, and when power is applied to it, the circuit is completed, and the LED/motor turns on. To control these elements, you can use the command line, or libraries are available for Python, C, and Scratch to make a script (which you would use in your example with the music).Note: NEVER SOLDER ANYTHING DIRECTLY TO THE PI!! Use a breadboard or PCB.,\n",
       "       Yes you can, I have done it. I wrote it with a script that could be controlled with a web interface. I used Flask and Python to create a website where I was able to control a little motor that was connected with the GPIO. This was a school project for me, and it was very enjoyable! So yes, you can control LED light and a steppermotor. http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2012/07/stepper-motor-control-in-python/  Here is a script I used. You can even hook a LED sensor on the Pi that looks for a LED light so that when a light is detected the steppermotor of that particular Pi starts to go down or up. We have made an animation with several Pi's that way! Note that we used a very small steppermotor from China that costed about $2. Edit: I did it with a driver board. Note that. Did not directly put it to the Pi, it'll destroy it. But it is possible to use the Pi with LEDs, steppermotors etc. That was the point I was trying to make. ,\n",
       "       Yes.  My suggestion is to look into the myriad of attachments that can be purchased online to attach to the GPIO connections from the PI.  There is a robotics package available that includes servos, stepper motors, led controls, etc.   I've seen complete CNC mills that could easily have their own computers replaced by Raspberry Pi's producing an upgrade in functionality by connecting their motor controllers and sensors directly to the Pi GPIO connector.  But note: users of the Raspberry Pi boards are generally up against power limits.  You won't be able to draw much power from the Pi's power supply through the micro-usb power connector on the Raspberry Pi board to power a motor -- most uses like a motor must be self-powered and use only the control capability of the PI.  One or two LED's lit at a time shouldn't be a problem in this regard.,\n",

Mpg123 requires you to use a collection index to select which track in the playlist to play. Here I've created a playlist file (/home/pi/tmp/playlist) with 3 entries (1.mp3, 2.mp3, 3.mp3). Using the loadlist &lt;entry&gt; &lt;url&gt; command I'm telling it to load and play the track at the corresponding playlist position:import pipes# Index of currently playing trackcurrent = 0t = pipes.Template()# Command to load playlist and begin playback at current + 1t.append('echo loadlist ' + str(current + 1) + ' /home/pi/tmp/playlist', '--')f = t.open('/tmp/fifo', 'w')f.close()This approach leaves you with some additional responsibilities (implement random shuffle, listen for/respond to track ending signals, etc.), but I think it offers more options for fine grained control over a running mpg123 instance than is afforded by the -C remote option.

These $10 switches have built in wlan network connectivity, an esp8266 chip which can be reflashed with custom firmware and have built in temp and humidity sensors.The flashed switches and sensors are supported by freely available open source home automation systems such as FHEM and domoticz which will run on the rpi and provide the automation you require - sensor reading, switching based on temp, humidity etc and provide you with a customisable gui frontend.I am doing exactly this with an rpi and flashed sonoff th 16 with temperature sensor which monitors the temperature of our garden swimming pool water!,\n",

You are not tied to that -- other init systems commonly used with linux (remember: the kernel is linux) are systemd and upstart -- but you do need an init system of some sort.You can also put init in an initramfs and have it built into the kernel, in which case you could get away without a root filesystem, but that seems pointless in this case. init is the only userland application started by the kernel.  Normally, it then starts processes which open ttys with a login, and then other services that may start a display manager, sshd, etc.  You may not need the login, but you probably want the tty; you could also just start sshd directly instead.

These partitions are labelled \"boot\" and \"root\". IF you have other OS's installed then they might be in other places.see:https://github.com/raspberrypi/noobs/wiki/NOOBS-partitioning-explainedTherefore, you could take these partitions with, say, parted/gparted, and put them only on a SD-card. If you haven't done massive modifications to the boot partition you could even just copy only the root partition (save it in some other drive), then put a fresh Raspbian image on a new SD-card, and paste your saved old root partition on top of the newly created one on the new card. This would bring all your installed programs, desktop preferences etc. The two partitions are extended logical partitions, and you would have to change the boot partition to be primary and first (use gparted again). Then you would also need to edit cmdline.txt in the boot partition to tell the system where the root partition is. Also, remember to expand the root partition in order to get all the space that NOOBS was using to your own use.This is easy to do with a linux computer, if you don't have one, you can make your windows computer into a temporary linux computer with Gparted live. It's an image that you get from the net and burn on cd/dvd/usbflash and then boot from it to a linux with gparted (a GUI-program).,\n",

It actually wasn't difficult at all, provided you have some time and an extra SD card.I started by creating a script that backed up everything I was interested in.  Credit goes to this article for getting me started.  I think rsync pushing to a remote machine would be better suited for this, but I had enough space on the original SD card to go this route.  I can provide instructions for rsync too needed. Rsync supports exludes also, just exclude the same directories that the following script excludes.    tar -zcvpf /backups/fullbackup.tar.gz --directory=/ --exclude=proc --exclude=sys --exclude=dev/pts --exclude=/etc/fstab --exclude=backups .Next, I installed Raspian on the spare SD card, then moved the backup over to the new card. To restore the backup, I rantar -zxvpf /fullbackup.tar.gzIf you use rsync instead, you could probably restore a backup remotely, if space on either SD card is a concern.NOTE:  I didn't exclude fstab, and the article I linked doesn't mention to do so.  Because NOOBS has a different partition map, it failed to boot.  I just plugged the SD card into another linux machine and edited fstab to point to the proper partition.

Hopefully, it should work.To the extent of my knowledge, those steps should accomplish what you were looking for.Additional (optional?) steps:You could delete all non-essential files from RECOVERY (the ones that were there previous to overwriting them, the OS images that come with NOOBS, etc).You could use gparted or some other partition manager to delete BOOT partition, resize (shrink) RECOVERY partition, and move your RASPBIAN partition to the left. This would \"defragment\" your sdcard and allow for a smaller general footprint.You could edit /etc/fstab in your raspberry to reflect the new partition structure and filesystem mount points, and avoid warnings at boot.If you are courious about why this works, I recommend you have a look at this wiki article about NOOBS partitioning and boot process.Hope this helps!,\n",

To backtrack a bit, Each process, except the kernel, lives in a little sandbox that appears to the code as a completely empty memory with 64 bit addresses this looks like ~16EB (exabyte). This space must contain all the code, supporting code, and data for the application.This virtual memory is shotgunned into the physical memory by the kernel and the processor.  So while each individual process potentially has 16EB of virtual memory, you still only have 1GB on the RPI to use for all your applications. Now to the question - Why would one want to use a 64 bit OS on a system with so little physical memory? There are a few possibilities. You want to use a piece of software only available for arm64You want to test/develop software for arm64You want to memory map large IO into a process  One of the advantages of a 64 bit memory space is that you can, in certain cases map an entire memory device like flash into memory. In which case 32 bit addressing is not sufficient to memory map, say a 32GB serial flash device.You have a computational need for larger hardware registers   If you deal with large numbers or use software algorithms that pack multiple values into a single variable, the larger registers may provide an advantage.You have a need for some other enhancement or fix in the command set   The new arm architecture that supports 64 bits may have other improvements or enhancements that you would like to use. ,\n",
       "       NGsolve doesn't seem to require 64-bit support, however, there's no binary package available for it that could run on a Raspberry Pi. You could try installing it from sources as described here. I didn't spot anything that could prevent it from working on Raspbian, but I haven't tried to install it either.,\n",
       "       Technically I don't see why it wouldn't work as long as it was powered independently of the PI but it would be a huge expensive waste of money because it would be so slow.  All USB ports and the ethernet port on the Raspberry PI share the same slow USB2 bus so it really wouldn't be a good idea to cram the USB ports with external hard drives.  Having said that if all you want to do is to increase capacity even though it's really slow then go ahead but even then there are cheaper and more elegant solutions than this.  A simple powered USB hub with USB hard drives is a neater solution.  It would help though to answer one big question - why?  What is your motivation for wanting to do something like that?,\n",
       "         What would you recommend then? I was hoping to get an external SSD HDD that would be speedy. The issue is that for a peripheral bus (SATA, USB, PCI, etc.) controller to be effective, it has to be attached directly to the SoC.  On a board like the Pi (or pretty much anything else, including normative laptops, desktops, etc.) you cannot add to what is already there in this sense.  You cannot wire anything directly to the processor.1 You have to work with what is there.Hence, people make SATA adapters for the Pi, but they are really just SATA -> USB adapters (except they are noticeably more expensive -- go have a look at a generic SATA to USB adapter online).  The USB hub on previous models of Pi was actually the ethernet controller too, meaning 100 Mbit ethernet had to share a bus with 280 Mbit USB where the limitation was the latter and it was shared.  The Pi 3B+ is an improvement on this in that it has an independent Gbit ethernet port.This means the fastest port on the 3B+ is no longer USB, it's the ethernet port.  So if you wanted maximum throughput, it could be by connecting directly via ethernet cable to another system which can properly house SATA drives, and you might, at least in theory, get speeds close to 100 MB/s, although whatever network protocol you use will take a chunk of that.  All things considered, this is probably not a worthwhile solution.Short of that you just have to be happy with the USB.  Since any new harddrive you buy today will be capable of matching that bottleneck, there's not much point in buying one that's faster than anything else -- attached to a USB 2.0 port, they're all likely equal.  The one thing I would recommend is that if you buy one that doesn't have it's own power supply, don't get anything too beefy, and definitely do not get more than one.  I.e., if you want multiple drives, get ones that have independent power supplies (or you could use a powered hub, but this might add to the bottleneck).1. Actually that not true -- the stuff on the GPIO breakout is connected directly to the SoC, and in that sense you can attach things directly to it.  However, nothing on the breakout has the potential to rival USB 2.0 speeds.,\n",

Where nessacery providing support for the thing the button is pressed on.On the other hand a mechanical button pusher is likely to need to be held in a very precise location relative to the button for reliable operation.

If you have a stockpile of RGB's, and time to experiment, you can illuminate a single LED color on the RGB &amp; mix them with others to generate tertiary colors.

If you have a bunch of LEDs and you want to go to the next level of complexity, you can use the dot correction to make them light up evenly.The 2k resistor on pin 20 is required to set the output current. IOUT = 3.96 * RIREFRegular LEDs are usually 20mA, so that formula gives 2k for the resistor,\n",
       "       I see two things that should be addressed in this question:How to connect and communicate with the TLC5940How to connect LEDs up to the TLC5940.For the first part, you will need to connect it to the i2c pins of the Raspberry Pi's P1 header (which are pins 3 (data) and 5 (clock)).  You can then use pin 1 (3.3 V) for the VCC of the TLC5940.  It recommends from 3 V to 5.5 V for input according to the datasheet.  You will also want to connect a ground pin from P1 (e.g. pin 5) to the GND of the TLC5940.  And you will need an additional GPIO (e.g. pin 7) to connect to the TLC5940's XLAT signal to latch in the value of the shift register.Then you will need to setup the Pi for i2c communication:  assuming raspbian, remove i2c-bcm2708 from /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf, load it and i2c-dev and you should get /dev/i2c-0 and /dev/i2c-1 (i2c-1 is what you will need to use for Model B Rev. 2 Pis).Finally, you will need to use an i2c transaction to set the value of the internal shift register, and then signal the XLAT (if using pin 7, it's GPIO 4).I also overlooked the GSCLK pin.  You will need to provide a clock input so that the internal counter actually increments, which can be done from another GPIO line if it's configured correctly.  I also don't think the 3.3 V rail will provide sufficient current for this application (50 mA max).  If you move to the 5 V rail, you can draw up to ~300 mA, but should use 5 V logic for i2c then (and the GSCLK), requiring more components.For the second part, it sounded like you had that handled from some past Arduino project, unless I misread?,\n",

There may or may not be additional bytes after the first one. The higher level protocol defining what each byte means is device specific.

This means that if the Pi is issuing abus.read_i2c_block_dataorbus.write_i2c_block_datait first writescmdto the I2C bus before it reads.This is a useful feature because some I2C hardware requires initialization before a read can be made.On the Arduino this means that:First the,Wire.onReceive(yourCallback)function is called because cmd was written to the bus by the Pi.  cmd will be the first byte available on the bus.  If the Pi sent write request than the Arduino will stay in the Wire.onReceive callback until the function is complete.

Pursuant to that, I believe pretty much any media device with wifi should have a DLNA server available, and the pi can act as a client (or a server, but in this context it would be the client).You should investigate the possibilities for streaming audio from the devices and applications you intent to use first.  Mobile operating systems do not necessarily have a universal \"audio out\" stream, meaning it is per application, and those applications may have restrictions such that they will not work with the DNLA server or other third party streaming software (i.e., your only choice with such OS/application combinations may be the headphone jack or bluetooth).In any case, if this is your primary purpose for buying a pi, I would recommend against it.  The sound system associated with the 3.5mm jack is not high quality, has a noticeably lower than average max volume (meaning you will probably induce more signal-to-noise by having to crank your amp up higher) and is prone to interference from the board itself.

Both approaches add cost and complexity though, so you're probably better off starting with the Pi GPIOs, that's what they're for anyway :)Using an external microcontroller does have the advantage that you can program it to deal with debouncing or other I/O issues (such as PWM, blinking, analog inputs, etc), freeing up your Pi for game stuff.

You could always recycle an old Nintendo 8 bytes controller and use the arrows. Then you would need at least a few buttons lets say A and B with Select and Start. so just for your controls you used up a lot of the pins available to you and you dont have much left but its ok we can manage that.After that I would consider what kind of graphics you would like on your game. For a flat 2D game that you would program your self it will do the job. But if we are talking fast past game play with 3D well... you might find yourself with a project that will stay a project. But here is what I suggest. The idea of the game with a controller is nice and why not use the \"still\" potent power of an old P4 that will remain cheap and give you wider game play possibility. You can still build an awesome new kind of controller and custom design the box where it will all fit in to. I think that the raspberry Pi, as well as the Arduino, are good to explorer numerical world and behavior but they bring a regular PC a notch higher connecting your ideas to the physical world.,\n",

It should list V2 or V3 somewhere on or near the barcode sticker. That is the revision number. I found out that pre-built drivers posted on the official rPi forums or this repository tend to work very fine with V2, but I did have issues with V3.

You can check more details about it online.Some Raspberry devices (including mine) needs one more addition (optional, try only if above doesn't work), after modifying fstab, add a 5 seconds delay to loading the device as sometimes Raspbian finishes booting before the external hard drive is ready. In this case the external drive isn't auto mounted and it is skipped with an error at the start.Add the following property/value to the end of /boot/cmdline.txt:rootdelay=5Hope it helps!,\n",

In Thunar settings there in an option Mount removable media when inserted. If you had Nautilus then it has its own gnome-based automounting. Apparently, both XFCE and Gnome rely on udisks for automounting.If after the upgrade you used raspi-config and configured xorg to not start at boot then that would explain why automount stopped working for you.If you have xorg running at all times then you can install the packages with sudo apt install thunar thunar-volman and then in Thunar settings enable automounting.For me relying on a xorg desktop for USB mounting is not feasible, since I don't want to have an xorg session always running, therefore, I looked at existing headless options, which included systemd mount/automount units, udev rules, but finally settled on usbmount which works with the downside that instead of partition labels the mount points are created as /media/usb1|usb2|usb3.. etc. In current raspbian jessy an edit was needed in order to make usbmount work as described here: in short, in /lib/systemd/system/systemd-udevd.service replace \"MountFlags=slave\" with \"MountFlages=shared\"This is what I finally ended up using:udev+systemd automountinghttps://github.com/six-k/automount-usbTo set up run sudo CONFIGURE.sh. ,\n",

       "       As most distributions come with mplayer installed, I use it for playing videos on the Linux framebuffer. It can be used to play video in a totally X-free system. There are some serious downsides to this approach which I mention below.export TERM=linuxsetterm -blank 0 -cursor off -powerdown 0 -powersave off \\        -bfreq 0 -blength 0 &lt; /dev/console &gt; /dev/consolemplayer -vo fbdev2,fbdev, -zoom -fs -really-quiet \\        -screenw 1280 -screenh 768 -xy 1024 \\        -geometry '50%:50%'        the_video_file.mp4setterm -cursor on -blank 10 &lt; /dev/console &gt; /dev/consoleDescription of the commands:The TERM environment variable is set to linux to 'trick' the setterm command into working.The setterm commands stop the linux console from interfering with the framebuffer. This means cursor blinking and screen blanking are disabled. The IO are connected to /dev/console because an ssh session uses a 'ttyS' device and setterm only works on (physical) 'tty' devices. The &lt; /dev/console > /dev/console part tells setterm to operate on the 'tty' devices.-vo fbdev2,fbdev, instructs mplayer to try the fbdev2 output driver, falling back to the fbdev driver, and (,) falling back to any other driver that works. Most likely no other drivers will work.-zoom -fs stretch the image to fill the desired screen (fullscreen).-really-quiet instructs mplayer to not print anything to the console. Normally it does. This text would be visible through the framebuffer image.-screenw 1280 -screenh 768 these are the pixel dimensions of your monitor. Be aware that if you have two monitors (i.e., a laptop and a TV connected via an HDMI cable) there are several screen \"dimensions.\" You want the real dimensions -- not the virtual dimensions. You can find real dimensions using cat /sys/class/graphics/fb0/modes-xy 1024 instructs mplayer to scale the video to a width of 1024 pixels. Why not 1280? Because mplayer scales the video height in proportion to maintain the video's aspect ratio. However, if the height it larger than the screen dimensions (1280x768 in this case) it will simply fail. There are ways around this, but it is a bit of a rabbit hole...-geometry '50%:50%' instructs mplayer to place the video images in the centre of the framebuffer.Notes, pitfalls, downsides:mplayer doesn't (to my knowledge) support hardware acceleration. Decoding and drawing to the framebuffer are both slow without hardware acceleration. Because the raspberry pi cpu is so low-powered, you will simply not be able to play videos with large dimensions. Try the unrelated omxplayer if possible.mplayer is unforgiving regarding the screen and video dimensions. If you ask it to scale the video beyond the physically available screen, it will simply fail to play. Video dimensions can be found using ffprobe, mplayer, file, or in many other ways.The linux framebuffer is not really designed for this sort of thing. It cannot be modified without rebooting, and is set with kernel boot parameters. Something like DirectFB would be an improvement.Because the framebuffer will overwrite the console, and you are using the console to launch mplayer, there may be some text visible during playback. You can get around this by launching playback on an unused terminal. This can be done with something like:openvt --console=6 --switch --force --wait -- \\bash -c \"cd '$(pwd)' &amp;&amp; \\/opt/script_containing_above_commands.sh \"'$@' '' $@ &amp;>/dev/null &amp;But this is a bordering on the scope of your question.,\n",

       "       The main risk I can think of is file system damage. Your Pi is reasonably likely to unexpectedly shut down in the event of insufficient power. If you (or a background process) happened to be in the middle of writing something to the SD card at that point you run a decent risk of corrupting the file system. That might put your Pi out of action until you can re-image the SD card.If your power supply is extremely underpowered you run a reasonable risk of physically damaging it (the power supply, not the Pi). Exercise a little common sense when you're considering your options and don't try to power the Pi from a 100mA supply. Aside from that I think you'll be OK - underpowered components usually just don't work, rather than coming to harm. If you wanted to be super cautious I suppose you could unplug everything from the GPIO pins and avoid connecting the Pi to external storage. That should minimise the risks of damaging anything electrical or corrupting drives. ,\n",
       "       If it is necessary to do this, you can minimize damage as follows.STEP 1: Remove all USB peripherals you can, and power the rest externally.Place a single, POWERED USB hub between ONE USB port on the Pi and all USB peripherals.  (Powered hubs have their own bricks.  Unpowered hubs will make things worse.  If you need more ports, DAISY CHAIN THE HUBS, do not use two ports on the Pi.)RATIONALE: USB peripherals initially use up to 35mA per port, but can negotiate up to 500mA per port after that initial connection.  If you used two powered hubs, you could still be drawing up to 70mA (though probably not).  Using a single USB port connected to a powered hub guarantees your lowest possible host power draw.STEP 2:Lower all clock rates-- CPU clock, GPU clock, memory clock, and the SPI clock in use for SD cards.  (You can find the last one in the instructions for overclocking SD cards).Put the clock rates back to normal after you get a proper supply.  (You might even find you can overclock now, provided you use proper heatsinks and cooling.)RATIONALE: The amount of power of power used per instruction is fairly constant.  If you have less power available, you need to use less energy per second-- fewer instructions per second means less power used.This step is easy, just tedious.  Tweak one setting at a time, and test thoroughly.  Start by knocking 25% off all the stock speeds.  If possible, wire up an ammeter and MEASURE CURRENT DRAW BEFORE AND AFTER EACH CHANGE, it is easy to do and will be very useful for you to know.STEP 3: Disable all GPIO equipment you can live without.This includes individual features on each device, and this is often overlooked.  Consider:Turning down the gain on transmitters and receiversShutting off or dimming backlight displaysLowering display frameratesMinimizing volumes on speakersAllowing longer acquisition times for GPS antennasFalling back to lower speed wireless standardsReducing ADC and DAC sampling ratesRunning motors one at a time, when possible (do not pan and tilt at the same time, etc.)Reduce signaling speeds (serial baud rates, etc.)Reduce optical gate/gray code wheel duty cyclesRATIONALE: Your payload is your purpose, but you may be able to meet your design goals in a round-robin fashion, using one device at a time, rather than just leaving all of them on all the time.  This is the hardest step, but will also be the most rewarding for future designs.,\n",
       "       In digging through the C++ source code to XBMC, I noticed that two types of events are anticipated, but you may have three possible scenarios.Device is loaded at time of launch for XBMC (CLinuxInputDevices::InitAvailable) [handled]Device is \"hotplugged\" during execution of XBMC (CLinuxInputDevices::CheckHotplugged) [handled]Device driver reconfigured an existing device after XBMC started [not handled]I would bet, based upon the CLinuxInputDevices::Open function, that one of those error messages appear during startup because the device driver cannot honor some of the ioctl calls.  Subsequent calls to read events can't properly talk to the kernel structures, so XBMC thinks it has a device, but never initialized it properly.  Unplugging and reloading the dongle is enough to trigger a hotplug event in XBMC.In short, one of two things would need to happen.  First, the driver talking to the dongle (e.g. logitech-djdevice), could unplug and replug the device into the hotplug system in order for XBMC to detect the change.  Second, XBMC could trap the failed open() call (it ignores the return code now) and keep polling the device hoping it will successfully initialize.I don't have the resources to recompile the code, so I can't submit a patch at this time.For archive purposes, this analysis was based upon the Apr 27, 2014 checkin of xbmc/xbmc/input/linux/LinuxInputDevices.cpp.  Potential error messages you might see include:CLinuxInputDevice: could not open device:CLinuxInputDevice: could not grab device:CLinuxInputDevice device: fcntl(F_GETFL) failed:CLinuxInputDevice device: fcntl(F_SETFL) failed:Of course, I could be in the completely wrong section of the code, if that part is for keyboards only, so I'll point you to another area interested in PERIPHERAL_HID version instead of calling it an input device.

Pins like MISO, MOSI or CLK work like normal GPIO pins, but they are labeled that way so that people who want to do specific things (like SPI interfacing) know which pins to use for that. Any pin that isn't labeled 3.3V (like pin 1 and pin 17, always on), 5V (pin 2 and pin 4, always on, 5 volts) or GND (ground AKA negative power) works as a normal GPIO pin with regular inputs and outputs.

To find out if a bus or interface is enabled, go to Preferences -> Raspberry Pi Configuration -> Interfaces.)As for the temperature sensor, you may need to use an analog to digital converter, because some sensors output using analog signals. One example of a digital to analog converter is the MCP3008 (learn about that here).Hope this helps,Dan :),\n",

But in the title it gives us a maximum of 30 minutes and says it can output up to 600 W per hour at 220 V.That makes a storage of 300 W at 220V.Let's take the peak wattage they take. (Watts is measured per hour w/h, so it's an easy calculation.)It depends on the Pi and Power Supply, since every Pi takes another peak wattage from the supply.Every Pi compared:Raspberry Pi 1: 1.5 W (model A), 1.0 W (model A+), 3.5 W (model B), 3.0 W (model B+) or 0.8 W (model Zero)Raspberry Pi 2: 4.0 WRaspberry Pi 3: 4.0 WLet's take the Pi 3, which takes 4 Watts/hour peak.Your supply is 300w/h.Let's do the math here:(300w/h) / (4 w/h) = 75 hours of service.But we have to take in account that the power supply for the pi itself wastes some energy (that's normal and you can feel this as the heat coming up from it). So it's a few hours less than 75, let's say 70 or even 60. that's nearly two days then, if you're going with the Raspberry Pi 3.PS. This isn't the fully correct way to get the perfect time it will run.Source for the Pi Wattage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi,\n",
       "       You should contact the maker of the UPS you are using and discuss the power requirements of the Raspberry Pi and whatever else might be connected to it. I would discuss this with them in detail saying you want to have it provide power for 15 days, because they might recommend another model for you. Or additional batteries. I don't believe most UPSes are made to handle supplying power for that long a period of time. A UPS also has a built-in fan, which is likely to draw even more power the longer it is on.,\n",
       "       The UPS you chose doesn't list their exact times, so there's no way to calculate how long it will last under a given load. I'll run through the calculation for a couple different UPSs, so you can repeat it on one of your choice.I'm going to use this UPS, which has a similar wattage rating as the one you chose: CyberPower EC650LCD ECO 650VA/390W.The specs on that page list the following:VA Rating: 650 VA.Watts: 390 Watts.Battery Run Time:10.7 minutes (160 W)2.8 minutes (325 W)At Half Load (min.): 8At Full Load (min.): 2OK, so it can run for 10.7 minutes at 160 Watts. That means it has a capacity of (10.7 / 60) * 160 = 28.53 Watt-Hours. (High draw applications will decrease the amount of time it'll last faster, because of how batteries work. Note that the \"at full load\" number isn't half the value of \"at half load\". Therefore, pick the statistic that's closest to our target draw, which is very small for the Pi.)Let's say the Pi draws 1 Amp at 5 Volts. That's 5 Watts draw. (Your Pi is probably a bit lower than that, but there's some inefficiencies in the various conversions, so this'll work for now.)OK, 28.53 Watt-Hours, 5 Watts. 28.53 Wh / 5 W = 5.7 Hours. The UPS I linked above should be able to power your Pi for around 5.7 hours. Now, let's approach this math from the other side: The Pi draws 5 Watts. If you want a full day, that's 24 * 5 = 120 Watt-Hours. We need to find a UPS that has at least 120 Wh of capacity.Here's a larger UPS: CyberPower Intelligent LCD Series CP1500AVRLCD 1500VA 900W.VA Rating: 1500 VAWatts: 900 WBattery Run Time:At Half Load (min): 11At Full Load (min): 311 minutes at half load. Full load is 900 Watts, so that's 11 minutes at 450 Watts. (11 / 60) * 450 = 82.5 Wh. Still not large enough.OK, let's try this one: CyberPower TAA Compliant Smart App Sinewave PR1000LCDRT2UTAA 1000VAVA Rating: 1000 VAWatts: 700 WBattery Run Time:Runtime at Half Load (min): 32Runtime at Full Load (min): 1132 minutes at half load. Full load is 700 Watts, so that's 32 minutes at 350 Watts. (32 / 60) * 350 = 186.67 Wh. OK, that'll keep you running for a full day!As you search for UPSs, watch out for ones that claim a run time, but don't specify how much power is being drawn for that time. There's no way to tell how they came up with that number, and there's no way to do the math to figure out what the capacity is. With the one you linked, the front of the box says \"10-30 minutes\", but there's no way to tell what the wattage of that is, so we can't use that number in our calculations.Also, one thing to keep in mind is that most UPSs are designed to keep a system running for a few minutes, not a full day. 5 Watts for the Pi is almost nothing, the internal circuitry of the UPS is probably taking that much as well, and we didn't account for that in our calculations, and as our runtimes get longer and longer, it'll throw our math off more and more, but this'll get you close. ,\n",

I did a quick Google search and found evidence of Oracle Java being available for ARM, but I couldn't find a download link.However, having run Hadoop on 32 PlayStation 3's (which also have low memory and non-Intel architecture), I can tell you it's rather slow. The Raspberry Pi is even worse because it doesn't have gigabit Ethernet (PS3 does), and communication is always a major issue in the high performance computing world.

       "       I am sorry but there is no such thing as a 2A or any amp battery. There is amp-hour rating symbolised as Ah,AHr,A·h. When you say 2 I assume you mean 2Ah with the 12volt battery. It does not mean you can use 2A maximum. You can draw 5Amps from the battery if you want.Some more information can helpWhat revision board is it?Do you plug the stick in when the Pi is on? Does it reboot?Do you have it plugged in and does the Pi boot normally- not safe mode?What is the 1117 amp rating?Like you said the Pi uses maximum 1A which which should at the worst case give you 2 hours battery time. Now why the peripherals do not turn on might be caused by the line converter you are using. Looking at a generic spec sheet of a LM1117 it is rated for 800ma - These things are smart now a days with current limiting, short circuit protection, etc. Possible causeWhat you can be experiencing is the current limiting feature on the regulator? Maybe the peripherals does try and turn on but because it does not have enough current the internal circuit of the peripheral gives up and does not turn on again (like a polyfuse) so you have to take it out and try again. It happens so quick that the Pi does not experience a dip and does not restart but too quick for you to notice anything happen.,\n",
       "       At a current of 1A, the LM1117 is dissipating (12-5)*1 = 7W. Unless you have a big heat sink, the thermal limiting will shut the regulator down.You would be better off to use a Buck converter. There are some on ebay quick cheaply based on the LM2596. The more efficient conversion will double your battery life,\n",
       "       The linear regulator is definitely the sticking point here. A switched mode regulator is much more efficient and therefore won't take a chunk out of your battery life in and of itself. The MoPi board provides one in an easy interface for connecting batteries like yours to the Pi, and also lets you know about charge status so that the Pi shuts down nicely. I'd estimate a 12 V, 2 Ah battery to run for around 12 hours.,\n",
       "       It probably won't damage the RPi, but it may cause random crashes. Depends on many factors. Power supply, other periperals, cpu load etc.The main polyfuse is evil. If the current is on the high side it could trip after a few hours even if nothing else changesI don't power mine through the polyfuse anymore. Much more reliable.,\n",
       "       The worst part is plugging in the hard drive. The initial jolt of power needed to spin the internal discs can cause the Pi to reset. But if your is not then that is fine. When it is spinning the power consumption is stable and low, even when accessing the drive it does not go up that much.If you have a Rev2 board and a good 2Amp power supply you should be OK. But be careful of adding any thing else. For example adding Wifi or 3G modem might just go overboard and start to cause issues.,\n",
       "       If it's 7200 RPM, you might have a problem. Check the volts/amps on the hard drive label and compare it to the maximum USB outage. if it's marginally over it, that's ok, your hard drive should still function. Either way, if you happen to trip a polyfuse, simply wait a couple hours for it to cool down, then try to find a USB Hub.Another route is to make like some USB DVD drives, which have 2 USB ports: one for power, one for data and power. If you're comfortable you can cut a spare cable and DIY it.,\n",

       "       There are too many variables that effect how much power a device draws to try and answer this for you directly.  So, I will try to give you a process:Go get yourself a USB-based power-draw measuring device (a good one is the Charger Doctor, but any that show you how much amperage you are drawing will do).Use the device to measure what your amperage draw is on average while your device is running and doing what it is meant to do. Remember that variable workloads will effect this drastically over time.Use this quick (and very dirty) calculation to figure it out:Battery Size (in maH) / average-current-draw (mA) * efficiencyTypically an efficiency value of 0.7 is used for most small electronics.Example:Your battery is 2400 maH in size.Your average power draw of the device is 200 mA (just an example - your measurement will vary!)Equation: 2400 / 200 * 0.7 = 8.4 hours of battery lifeThis is a VERY subjective measure, and you should always do real-world tests to verify.  But at least it should get you in the ballpark range of what a given size of battery will get you.Good luck!,\n",

       "       TL;DR: 3-5 hours at moderate load.They use the Ah rating for the li-ion batteries at nominal 3.7V. You can always stick semi-expensive panasonic 2800mAh 18650s in there if the vendor has lied about the capacity. I use some from a golfcart in my USB batteries. Gung-ho.So you have 3.7V*2.4Ah=8.8Wh.  Assuming a boost efficiency of 85%, you have 7.5Wh. In my many tests, I’ve had Pi1 and 2 far below 2.5W, usually peaking at 1.5W (I don’t overclock). 7.5/1.5=5 hours. EXPECT less, maybe 3 hours. Can’t recommend the USB ampmeters, use a DMM set to ‘A’, and measure current in series with a pair of clip-on probes. For power longevity, you can do a few more or less invasive things, like cut off LEDs, use memory filesystems, and use google to find powersaving tricks for Pi. I’ve seen libraries for a greener Pi experience.It is better, however, to use a car battery instead, with a quality step down converter to 5.1V. Stepping down voltage is always more efficient than boosting it. Use a LVCO of 11.6V, you’d need e.g. a TLV431 with vref 1.25 for this... https://electronics.stackexchange.com/a/318196/147045BTW: The TLV431 can be used with Li-Ion batteries - like venerable 18650s - a recommended LVCO is 3.3V for a parallel bank, or 6.6V for a parallel-series bank.A nice 90Wh S/LA battery is cheap and small. About the size of a baby’s head. A big battery of about 720Wh is the size of lady ada’s head (but not pink or purple), and would let you run at MAXIMUM POWER, SCOTTY!

       "       Ok so I've done some more digging and several more hours of experimenting, and here's a more thorough answer, including info on how to get xrdp remote sessions to have the nice mouse cursor again instead of the big \"X\".Background info:It appears to me that Raspberry Pi 3 is the first Pi to come pre-installed with RealVNC, and RealVNC interferes with xrdp, so we must break the RealVNC install in order to get xrdp to work. You can see that RealVNC is installed by going to Start --> Preferences --> Raspberry Pi Configuration.

Its icon starts with a green capital \"V\". Click on the icon if you want to see the server window pop up, like this:Anyway, close it and go back to the Raspberry Pi Configuration and disable it if you enabled it.It appears to me that RealVNC must use some custom-modified versions of both vnc4server and tightvncserver, so modifying either one of these will break the RealVNC install, which is what we are going to do. The fix:Let's assume you already did sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get install xrdp.Now, let's break the RealVNC install. I have tested it and any of the following 3 options by themselves will work to break the RealVNC install and allow xrdp to work:sudo apt-get install vnc4serverOR sudo apt-get install tightvncserverOR sudo apt-get remove xrdp vnc4server tightvncserver followed by sudo apt-get install tightvncserver and sudo apt-get install xrdpYou get the idea. I don't really think the order above or which option you choose matters.Now, when you go to Start --> Preferences --> Raspberry Pi Configuration you will see that RealVNC is broken because the VNC option will now be greyed out as follows:Done! Remote logins using xrdp now work.But...you'll notice that the mouse cursor in your remote session into the Pi 3 has an X instead of a normal cursor.

       "       Thanks to @user451777 for the tip on threading.

Crucially, the flashLed function doesn't lock up execution while the leds are blinking.The main thread uses a global variable to set the led colour, with the other thread using the global variable to switch on the relevant led. I believe global variables are generally frowned upon, so I'd be interested to hear of any better approaches.,\n",
       "       @Stephen Lead, re you question on globals. Sometimes, with things like threading functions globals seem like a reasonable options as the alternatives can be more complicated. However it's a good habit to always explicitly declare them as globaldef flashLed(e, t):    \"\"\"flash the specified led every second\"\"\"    global colour    while not e.isSet():because at some stage you will try to assign to the variable and struggle to figure out why it doesn't seem to have any effect.You can pass arguments to the function that are altered by other parts of your program or are altered by your function but the arguments have to be objects that are mutable. The easiest example would be a list, then you end up with the, only slightly artificial:def flashLed(e, t, colour):    ...        print(colour[0])colour = [\"red\"]e = threading.Event()t = threading.Thread(name='non-block', target=flashLed, args=(e, 2, colour))...        if(randomNumber &lt; 5):            colour[0] = \"green\"If you had more extensive information to communicate between the two threads then a list might seem more logical. Queues are also fairly simple to use and worth checking out in the docs.,\n",
       "       I'm relatively new to Python, but I have been able to flash the LEDs while continuing execution by using Pulse Width Modulation(PWM) which is built into the RPi.GPIO module. This in my opinion was a much easier and simpler way than threading as other anwsers suggest, however both methods would work well.Simply create a PWM object with the desired frequency and then call PWM.start(DC) and PWM.ChangeDutyCycle(DC) to start/alter the LED duty cycle. Continue on with your code and then call PWM.stop() to stop the LED.    #setup GPIO pins and import GPIO module    g = GPIO.PWM(pin1,1)    r = GPIO.PWM(pin2,1)    g.start(0)    r.start(0)    greenStatus = False    redStatus = False    def flashLED(color):        global greenStatus, redStatus        if color == 'green':            if redStatus:                r.ChangeDutyCycle(0)                redStatus = False            if not greenStatus:                g.ChangeDutyCycle(50)                greenStatus = True       elif color == 'red':           if greenStatus:               g.ChangeDutyCycle(0)               greenStatus = False           if not redStatus:               r.ChangeDutyCycle(50)               redStatus = True    try:            while True:            if newMail():                flashLED('green')            else:                flashLED('red')            #do other stuff here and LED will continue flashing    except KeyboardInterrupt:        g.stop()        r.stop()        GPIO.cleanup()Basically this code starts both LEDs with a duty cycle of 0 so they appear off. Every time flashLED(color) is called, it checks to make sure the opposite LED is off, if its not then its duty cycle is reset to 0. Then it turns on the other LED if it is not already turned on. The code is wrapped in a try/except so that at the end both PWM objects are stopped and the GPIO pins are cleaned up.,\n",

I'm not sure what country your from, but who is to say that your internet connection to your Raspberry Pi is all that reliable.

Storing the data on the Raspberry Pi is better as you'll have control over everything, you'll also then know how to setup PHP and MySQL on your Raspberry Pi. These will impact the RPi's performance, but much less than you probably think.In terms of cost, the least would be to do everything on your RPi.

       "       I don't use python for this stuff but hopefully that doesn't matter much.By my reading of 8.5.1, \"I2C Serial Bus Address Configuration\" you have the two address pins connected to other (non-I2C) GPIOs and their state determines the bus address; they should remain in the same consistent state.  Judging by your use of 0x40 = 0b1000000 you have both those lines low.Beware this means they must actually be outputs set low.  Not connecting them, or connecting them to inputs, is not the same.  I think you should then see address 0x40 occupied in i2cdetect.  I presume you've confirmed this.It refers to using that seven bit address with an eight bit either high or low to indicate read or write; those timing diagrams show  a \"7 bit serial address bus byte\" but if you look it is an actual 8-bit byte; the least significant bit is either 0 or 1.  However, I believe this is standard and the nature of the read vs. write methods deal with this so you should be sticking with the 0x40 address (the python interface is a little confusing to me this way; with C API you open a handle to the I2C node, /dev/i2c-1, then use an ioctl() to set the specific 7-bit device address, and thereafter the handle always refers to that specific device and no address is used, but you are always either reading or writing; I'm presuming your use of the python smbus API is correct).Then the first thing you should do is then write 16-bits in two bytes, MSB first, to register 0x02.  Presuming you want 14 bit resolution for both temp and humidity, following 1) a-b-c on pg. 11 this means the value here should be 0x1000.  Note I think Figure 10 at the top of that page (\"Writing Frame (Configuration Register)\") involves a misprint when it says for frame 3 &amp; 4 \"Data MSB/LSB from SLAVE\" -- that should either be \"from MASTER\" or \"to SLAVE\" (if you look at the ACK bits those are all \"by Slave\").\"0x1000\" because to read temp and humidity together, you want to set the 12th bit counting from 0, i.e., 0b0001 0000 0000 0000 (so the MSB is 16, 0x10).  This is also the \"reset value\" from table 2, pg 14.If there's a write_word method I would use that, not write_block.Then you \"trigger the measurements by executing a pointer write transaction with the address pointer set to 0x00\".Thus far that seems to be what you are doing, but it is then not clear whether you are either waiting for either the \"conversion time\" to pass (pg. 5) or until the DRDYn line goes low (connected to a regular GPIO as input).  Doing the latter is probably more of a hassle as it requires a poll or callback and takes up another pin, but it also seems like the most unequivocal method.The conversion time is 6.5 ms for both temp and humidity; I would guess those are concurrent but you could try both 7 and 14 ms waits (I don't think the resolution will always be that precise, and while you should get at least what you ask for you might experiment with ranges from 10-20 ms).Then you read two bytes from register 0x00 (temp) and two bytes from register 0x01 (humidity).,\n",
       "       Once past the initial question regarding setting address pointer for the Adafruit HDC1008 Temperature and Humidity breakout I ran into a second issue - reading two bytes at once.   This led me to find a complete solution on Python: Can I read two bytes in one transaction with the smbus module?, which works once the correct address is given for the I2C_BUS.  Shame the smbus module for python is not better documented.,\n",
       "       Well you could use a Solid State Relay which is much smaller and easier to control than a mechanical relay, using an MCU or in this case Pi's GPIO pin.You have to drive the input pin constantly to keep the relay on (just like a mechanical relay).

To avoid that you have to design another circuit that can sustain itself.But you can get these pretty cheap on eBay and they are completely safe (isolated), so they won't blow up the Pi and do not require a lot of power to drive them, about 3~10mA.

And that others are not led unsuspectingly to follow. So here I go off on that....The following comment also may be helpful to the OP and to others. The OP failed to state his jurisdiction(s) of interest. In many places lotteries of the type described by the OP are highly regulated or outright illegal. They are illegal in California, for example. Whether the activity is a prohibited 'lottery'  or whether the lottery regulations are being complied with may be a legal question requiring (almost certainly) the assistance of a lawyer. As a california attorney (and geek with grey hair) I can pretty much assure that the OP would have to be exceedingly careful not to violate California law with his activity. Other places may differ, but consult a lawyer in each jurisdiction.  It is likely the 'system' would need to be certified in various ways, otherwise it might not be gaming at all, it might just be an illegal scheme or fraud. As a geek I applaud the creativity of the OP and advise that DIEHARD statistical testing of the rpi3 hardware RNG have been reported and these tests are most strenuous and time consuming -and geeky - and the rpi3 has come out looking pretty good, imho. I'm not a certifying authority though.Testing Raspberry Pi Hardware RNGThe OP may also wish to be alerted to assuring the HWRNG is active in his version of ?.

       "       I have managed to partially restore the image data of captured frames from the packets I have captured with Wireshark. That gave me following insights:The image data transmitted on the USB connection is exactly the same as I get from Video4Linux, the driver does not manipulate it. If I request lower resolutions, then the image data is scaled by the webcam and transmitted in the requested resolution.That means that there are no internal scaling operations that would explain the problems I experience at high resolutions.The packets captured by Wireshark are incomplete, even if Wireshark pretends that everything was captured. The data is transfered in URB packets which are never longer than 62016 bytes. Each URB packet has up to 32 iso descriptors. Each iso descriptor has an offset and a length value, which locate the data associated with it within the packet. Usually half of these descriptors point to data that is beyond the end of the packet, e.g. I have an iso descriptor with an offset value of 94860 bytes in a packet that has only 62016 bytes. The corresponding data apparently has not been captured.I learned that wireshark can only capture packets with a maximum size of 65535 bytes, though it should be possible to bypass this by explicitely setting the snapshot length:$ tshark -i usbmon2 -s 131072 -w capUnfortunately that did not help. The captured packets were still no longer than 62016 bytes.The amount of data captured by Wireshark is always the same regardless of the choosen resolution, because between the data associated with the iso descriptors there are always large areas filled with 0's.For example, the iso descriptors of a captured packet would be as follows:USB isodesc 0: Offset [bytes]: 0, Length [bytes]: 584USB isodesc 1: Offset [bytes]: 3060, Length [bytes]: 584USB isodesc 2: Offset [bytes]: 6120, Length [bytes]: 584USB isodesc 3: Offset [bytes]: 9180, Length [bytes]: 584USB isodesc 4: Offset [bytes]: 12240, Length [bytes]: 584USB isodesc 5: Offset [bytes]: 15300, Length [bytes]: 584USB isodesc 6: Offset [bytes]: 18360, Length [bytes]: 584...As one can see, there is a huge amount of unused space in this packet. The data associated with the first iso descriptors extends from 0 to 584 bytes. Then, from position 584 to 3060 there are 2476 unused bytes, that are all set to 0.For high resolutions there are fewer unused bytes, for lower resolutions there are more. That way, the total amount of data captured is always approximately the same for all resolutions.Are these packets effectively transfered as they are captured by Wireshark, with loads of 0's? Probably not, because then there should be problems for all resolutions, not only for the high ones.So I guess that in the end, the issue is with the usb system.,\n",

How do you compile a c++ program to use Hard Float registers?Presuming it's g++, the current best practice invocation is probably: g++ --std=c++11 -Wall -WextraNotice none of those have anything to do with the hard float ABI because if you are using the compiler than came with your arm-linux-gnueabihf pi B+ distro, it will use the correct architecture settings anyway.

       "       7.476s disableusb.serviceThis implies you are running something in the foreground because it is not persistent so you feel there is no point in backgrounding it.  However, if it takes that long to do its thing, perhaps you should fork it to background as soon as it starts instead.The issue here is simply that it is more likely to benefit your boot time than leaving it in the foreground is, although it may not make any difference either way.  However, if something else depends upon it completing (as opposed to simply completing initialization successfully, which is more applicable to a persistent service), then you should leave it as.  I see things such as: 1.736s keyboard-setup.service and 958ms kbd.service. They take almost 3 seconds.I've never looked into it because it does not matter much to me, but I believe there is something wrong about the way the \"keyboard setup\" is handled on Raspbian.  I've seen it run 90 seconds before being killed by systemd.  Do I need them if I am not using a keyboard? If not, how do I disable them?I suppose not, but this may create a hassle for you if you suddenly do need a keyboard...or it might make no difference at all -- part of my suspicion is that it actually isn't accomplishing anything, since the \"keyboard setup\" is something that is static configuration and can be manually changed as required. To disable a service, sudo systemd disable ....raspi-config.serviceOdd this is still there since it is supposed to disable itself after it is run -- but that might not happen if you ignored it.  That might relate to the keyboard thing.  If possible you should plug in a monitor and see if it pops up post boot.  In any case this is something else you might as well disable.  Here is the plot: http://www.eternal-lands.com/plot.svgI think you should make disableusb.service After=sysinit.target.,\n",
       "       Looking at the graph, it seems clear that disabling console-setup.service won't actually speed anything up anyway. As you can see networking.service is waiting until disableusb.service completes, so a 1.6 second load time for console-setup.service run in parallel won't affect the overall boot time at all.There's an idea in scheduling of a critical path which, when any activity in this path is delayed, causes delays to the entire project. The other activities have 'float', i.e. they are not critical, and can be delayed without affecting the final finish time.It is this critical path which you must save time on, not the non-critical activities. systemd-analyze critical-chain will help you identify the  critical activities, although you can pretty much spot them on the plot. Any marginal gain in disableusb.service would help your boot time significantly. It might also help to understand why your services take so long. For this, Bootchart2 might be useful. It can be installed with:apt-get install systemd-bootchartTo actually enable it, edit /boot/cmdline.txt and set:init=/lib/systemd/systemd-bootchartAfter booting is complete, you'll find the chart saved in /run/log as an SVG file.

       "       I recommend installing numpy via apt-get not via pip as the latter needs to compile the lib on the Pi and that is no fun. Not sure about pandas but I would expect something similar. So use:sudo apt-get install &lt;program name or abbreviation&gt;With program name being something like 'python-numpy'.Pip on the other hand should already be installed if Python is available. Update:The MagPi, Issue 64 reports about piwheels:  Pi Foundation Community Manager Ben Nuttall has released piwheels, a set of  pre-compiled Python modules that reduces the install time from tens of minutes to a couple of seconds. Pip is the best way to install Python packages, as it grabs the very latest version. However, often these packages “have been implemented in C and require compilation,” Ben explains. Compilation takes ages, however – installing the NumPy package on a Pi 3 can take over 20 minutes.    The Python community solved this problem a while back with ‘wheels’, pre-compiled versions of packages for common hardware and software combinations.  However, until Ben’s project, there were no wheels for a Pi running Raspbian.  Enter Ben with his epic project to pre-compile all 750,000 wheels for the Raspberry Pi. With some help from SQL expert Dave Jones (@waveform80), and  the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s web host Mythic Beasts (mythic-beasts.com), there are now over 670,000 wheels for more than 96,000 packages. NumPy now installs in seconds using the command sudo pip3 install numpy.So now one could use pip to install numpy and pandas without long compilation times simply by:sudo pip3 install numpy,\n",
       "       By default, Jessie Lite for Raspberry Pi have python 2.7 installed but does not have pip/setuptools/wheel installed. To install pip, run:sudo apt-get install python-pipThis will install setup tools and wheel along with pip.You can then use pip to install packages you will need. To install NumPy:pip install --user numpyor sudo pip install numpyI recommend using the --user flag to pip (without using sudo pip). This will install packages for your local user, and does not need extra permissions to write to the system directories.,\n",
       "       This will depend a lot based on what you want to plug into it. The RPi Zero will need at least 100 mA (though this is a minimum; you will need more at higher loads). Your hub and other devices will have their own requirements. Add these up and if they're under the power supply's output, you have a good chance. ,\n",
       "       It is possible it may work. If you plug the big USB into the HUB and your power supply USB into the big USB which is plugged intot he HUB, then the small USB into the Pi power, that should provide power to everything. Then you plug the USB HUB, USB host cable into the Pi and that should recognise the HUB in Raspian. Theoretically you will have 3 usable USB ports to use then. It is a bit strange way of doing it, but you have the cable that can do it. So it should be OK as the USB connection on the Zero does not seem to be connected to 5v, so you cant power the Pi via the USB, only via Power. If it was, you could back power form the HUB. As long as you don't use any other power supplies in the circuit it will be fine.,\n",

Lines  beginning with the word \"auto\" are used to identify the   physical interfaces to be brought up when ifup is run with the   -a  option.  (This option is used by the system boot scripts.)The first missing piece was the line auto wlan0. As far as I know, it can go anywhere in the file. That works until you try booting without the ethernet cable plugged in. Then, WiFi doesn't connect on boot and has to be manually triggered by running sudo ifup wlan0 or unplugging and reinserting the Wi-Fi dongle. The problem is caused by the ifplugd daemon, which turns network devices on and off when you plug them in or remove them. You can reconfigure it, or you can simply remove it with sudo apt-get purge ifplugd. If you have removed ifplugd, you should add the following lines to /etc/network/interfaces so that the ethernet connection will also connect when plugged in:auto eth0allow-hotplug eth0I'm not sure if the  auto lines are strictly necessary or if hotplug handles booting correctly in the absence of ifplugd, but this worked for me.

The  ADS1113/4/5 are designed with precision, power, and ease of  implementation in mind. The ADS1113/4/5 feature an onboard reference  and oscillator.

       "       Might be a power problem. According to the specification, E3531 consumes 500mA of current. Furthermore, \"Maximum power consumption\" is listed to be below 3W, which means you should expect peaks of up to 600mA, or even more the voltage on USB ports is below 5V. Since your RPi 3 provides 1.2A to its 4 USB ports, and assuming E3531 might use 600mA, you have another 600mA left for all other devices. You mention keyboard and mouse, which usually stay under 100mA, so if nothing else is connected you should be fine. If you have something else, or your keyboard and mouse are fancy (wireless, backlight etc.) you should check if you stay under the 1.2A limit. Alternatively, just plug the modem into a powered hub if you have one.Since you mentioned soldering 5V line to USB ports of RPi, I invite you to be careful and check board schematics. RPi uses this chip to provide current to USB ports, and it will most probably dislike it if you connect its output to 5V.

At this point the kernel should be spitting messages to console so any errors will be reported there.If there is an error before the kernel is loaded, the ACT blinks three or more times, meaning, according to this:3 flashes: start.elf not found4 flashes: start.elf not launched7 flashes: kernel.img not found8 flashes: SDRAM not recognised. You need newer bootcode.bin/start.elf firmware.No SD card is not exactly an error, though; in that case the ACT light will never flash or glow.

       "         the time difference [...] should be as minimal as possible (preferrably under 1 millisecond)That's not very feasible on a single pi sans networking, by which I mean, if you write a program to take a series of photographs spaced with millisecond granularity -- #1 at N, #2 at N + 1014 ms, #3 at N + 5135 ms, etc. -- this timing will fail badly.  You might be able to get them within 10-100 ms of the target, but again, this is with regard to one pi, no network.This is largely a constraint of the fact that the operating systems available for the pi are generally multi-tasking (as opposed to real-time).  However, before you go down the RTOS route, you might want to re-evaluate your requirements.  Unless you are taking pictures of very fast moving objects, 1 ms is totally irrelevant:1 Consider an object moving 100 km/h * 1000 = 100000 m/h / 3600 = 27.777 m/s / 1000 = 2 cm/ms.So, if this is for getting perfectly timed images at a racetrack for a science documentary, you probably want to invest in some much more expensive equipment.  However, if 250-500 ms latency is at all feasible, you might be able to achieve that over wifi, although I think there will be some percentage of inconsistent shots.  Using some kind of direct radio signal might get this down to 100 ms -- but I think a requirement for anything less than that is a requirement for completely different, very specialized, hardware.1. Note that the shutter speed of the camera is probably going to be in excess of 1 ms.,\n",

Finally, gtkterm should be installed on Raspberry Pi by using “sudo apt-get install gtkterm” command to make a serial connection between RPi3 and Copley motor driver.2017.06.28_Motor Control by using RPi3 and Copley_Fritzing2017.06.28_Motor Control by using RPi3 and Copley_PhotoHere is the Python code to control motor by using RPi3 and Copley motor driver#This program is written by Mustafa Güler who is Electrical and Electronics Engineer#at Teknolus Enerji located in METU Technopolis MET Campus.#The main goal of this program is to make communication between RPi 3 Model B and#Copley Motor Driver via serial communication protocolimport serialimport time#Defining the port parametersport = serial.Serial(\"/dev/ttyUSB0\", baudrate=9600, timeout=3.0)#Defining the Copley parameters#Variables____________________bytearrays____________________________________________Copley Parametersget_actual_motor_position   = [103, 32, 114, 48, 120, 51, 50, 13]                   # g r0x32absolute_move               = [115, 32, 114, 48, 120, 99, 56, 32, 49, 13]           # s r0xc8 1set_position                = [115,32,114,48,120,99,97,32,49,48,48,48,48,48,13]     # s r0xca [desired position; i.e. 100000]abort_move                  = [116, 32, 48, 13]                                     # t 0initiate_move               = [116, 32, 49, 13]                                     # t 1initiate_homing             = [116, 32, 50, 13]                                     # t 2amplifier_reset             = [114, 13]                                             # rdisable_amplifier           = [115, 32, 114, 48, 120, 50, 52, 32, 48, 13]           # s r0x24 0get_bus_voltage             = [103, 32, 114, 48, 120, 49, 101, 13]                  # g r0x1eget_amplifier_temperature   = [103, 32, 114, 48, 120, 50, 48, 13]                   # g r0x20get_serial_baud_rate        = [103, 32, 114, 48, 120, 57, 48, 13]                   # g r0x90set_function_gen_to_sine    = [115, 32, 114, 48, 120, 57, 56, 32, 50, 13]           # s r0x98 2set_freq_for_function_gen_Hz= [115, 32, 114, 48, 120, 57, 57, 32, 49, 13]           # s r0x99 1set_current_amplitude       = [115, 32, 114, 48, 120, 57, 97, 32, 49, 48, 48, 13]   # s r0x9a [current value; 100 for x0.01A]while True:    #Read the port information    read_port = port.readline()    #\"s r0xca 100000\" set position    port.write(bytearray(set_position))    print('set_position&gt;&gt;&gt;', read_port)    time.sleep(1)    #\"t 1\" initiate move    port.write(bytearray(initiate_move))    time.sleep(2)    print('initiate move&gt;&gt;&gt;', read_port)    #\"g r0x32\" get actual motor position    port.write(bytearray(get_actual_motor_position))    print('actual motor position&gt;&gt;', read_port)    time.sleep(1)port.close(),\n",

Be careful with this file, it is very picky with its formatting! Each parameter is seperated by a single space (it does not use newlines). Insert modules-load=dwc2,g_ether after rootwait. To compare, an edited version of the cmdline.txt file at the time of writing, can be found here.That's it, eject the SD card from your computer, put it in your Raspberry Pi Zero and connect it via USB to your computer. It will take up to 90s to boot up (shorter on subsequent boots). It should then appear as a USB Ethernet device. You can SSH into it using raspberrypi.local as the address.,\n",
       "       I suspect your not using the correct pin. BCM channel 27 is pin number 13.I found a relay similar to yours, the relay is on when the output is low, off when the output is high. I swapped your code round :import RPi.GPIO as GPIOimport timeGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)GPIO.setwarnings(False)GPIO.setup(27, GPIO.OUT)# relay onGPIO.output(27, GPIO.LOW) time.sleep(1)# relay offGPIO.output(27, GPIO.HIGH),\n",

I had this same exact problem.  Upon further investigation, it seems that GPIO.setup(27, GPIO.OUT) command switches the relay on, GPIO.setup(27, GPIO.IN) switches off. HIGH and LOW has no effect. Except, with HIGH command, green led gets dimmer. With LOW command, it turns back to usual brightness. That one is the exact problem i have...Make sure you you have ALL of the connections on the relay being grounded back to the Pi. Stting the pins to IN just makes them unusable for output.

       "       You need to step-down the 12V (or, more realistically a bit over 14V) down to 5V. For this you have to use either a linear regulator (simplest and cheapest solution - just one IC - LM7805T, one resistor and one transistor, keep in mind you will be wasting loads of energy through heat, up to two thirds of the energy the whole setup draws from battery, to be more exact) or a switchmode regulator, there are many modules available, most of them are just one eBay search away (keywords: step-down regulator).Also keep in mind that the Pi will continuously draw current, and that might lead to discharging the battery to the point where you might not be able to start your engine. Of course, do not forget about adding a fuse between your battery and the regulator, you don't want to start a vehicle fire in case something fails and short-circuits. ,\n",
       "       The most likely reason that you must use an external monitor first is to tell the Pi that hdmi is in use and it composite video as after it decides which output to use on boot, it will never use the alternate video out. This may also be occurring because the female to female Hdmi to vga adapter that you are using may not be telling the Pi that a device is plugged in, because the hdmi protocol has its own method to determine weather a monitor is plugged in or not, and certain HDMI to vga adapters do not follow proper hdmi specification in an attempt to save on costs. Furthermore your problem may be caused by the power draw from your vga adapter, please indicate if it uses external power or if it is drawing from the Pi. To attempt to force the Pi to use hdmi please enter hdmi_force_hotplug=1 and  locate a line that reads like this :sdtv_mode=0 (the number doesn't matter) and ensure that it is commented out with a hashtag, example: #sdtv_mode=0 if the line is not present then do not worry as you do not want it to be present hence the commenting out. Be sure to make these edits to your config.txt file. To prevent your Pi from using composite output.

To check, enter echo $PATH in  a  terminal.    The system looks through these directories in the order given and if  it can't find the program produces a command not found error.    Prepending the command with ./ effectively says \"forget about the  PATH, I want you to look only in the current directory\".    Similarly you can tell the system to look in only another specific  location by prepending the command with a relative or absolute path  such as:    ./Debug/hello : \"look for hello in the Debug subdirectory of my  current directory.\"    or /bin/ls : \"look for ls in the directory /bin\"    By default, the current directory is not in the path because it's  considered a security risk. See Why is . not in the path by  default? on Superuser for why.    It's possible to add the current directory to your PATH, but for the  reasons given in the linked question, I would not recommend it.I'm not sure why the answer said not to change your PATH, since the answer on SuperUser said that this was a \"very lame and useless anti-virus measure, and nothing stops you from adding dot to the path yourself.\",\n",

Connecting to a microcontroller  or other peripheral which has a serial interface. This can be useful  if you want the Raspberry Pi to control another device.

Also, most routers have USB-plugs built in.Any-who your method is sound, all you really need is a 5V relay connection between the hot (power) wire connection between the wire and the USB plug-in. The reason not to connect to the ground is because everything is grounded and if the fan hits something else grounded (seeing that its all metal) or with power its easy to make a connection.      ,\n",

Rather than cut this off and permanently alter your fan assembly, I suggest you buy a short adapter cable that has a Type A female connector on one end (see photo for example).  These can be purchased very cheaply online.  It doesn't matter what type of connector is on the other end of the adapter cable because you're going to cut that off to expose the bare wires.  Just plug your fan into the female end of this adapter cable, then connect the bare wires on the other side of the adapter cable to your relay.  Typically, the red wire is your 5V positive and the black wire is ground.,\n",
       "       Arch LinuxI'm a relatively new user of Arch, but have been using Linux - mainly Debian and its derivatives - for a few years now. I would highly recommend Arch, for someone who wants to tinker and learn - Debian is too easy...Arch gives you a basic working system, with a package manager. What more do you need? It doesn't even ship with Vim! You can choose exactly what you want and will always have the latest versions.Furthermore, whilst hard float support is awesome in it, Raspbian is full of bloatware. I don't like raspi-config, nor the fact it ships with code examples, which - as far as I know - aren't under package management, and therefore, cannot be easily removed and replaced if necessary. Arch will also have hard float support soon.The only warning I have is that Arch's python package is Python 3, not Python 2. Furthermore, using the latest packages all the time, may introduce security problems if used on an external facing box, but shouldn't be a problem on the Raspberry Pi.,\n",

You can split USB cable or make some adapter and connect +5V device line directly to +5V from your power supply.I have something like this:My power supply is a bit diffrent, but it has two USB outputs too.You don't need this with B+ model, but it's good to know.,\n",

The b+ uses 600 mA, so you power supply should be able to feed at least 500+600=1100 mA, and some for extra for good measure.But if you need a portable low power solution, maybe you want to have a look at the Model A+.,\n",
       "       Unfortunately they product description is all but clear and there is no datasheet available. From the product description however we learn:  This simple on-off switch is rated for 20A at 12V [...] Note: The LED can be illuminated with as low as 3.3V.To me that reads: connect anything between 3.3V and 12V and both the switch operates and the LED works fine. In my book that would include a current limiting resistor for the LED inside the switch, albeit one of the review suggests to have killed the LED while operating it without a resistor. Using 3.3V is also in the range of what the Pi's GPIO pins can handle. Yeah!The review furthermore explains how to wire the switch as follows:  There are 3 connection points. Apply voltage (12V) to the +. Apply ground to the Ground symbol. The third pin is your output pin for when the toggle is active. These are generally used in automotive applications (12V) however, they can be used in other applications, hence the note about how low the LED will operate.and  I measured the voltage drop across the LED as 1.9VCombining all the information I'd suggest to do the following:Connect 3.3V via a 1.5kOhm resistor to the + pin of the switch. If the switch has no internal resistor for the LED this would limit the current to about 1mA (quite low for the LED to be on the safe side). The resistor should also not prevent the switch from properly toggling its output.Connect GND to the earth pin of the switch.Connect a voltmeter to the third pin of the switch (or a GPIO pin of the pin, if you dare).If the output toggles according to the switch but the LED does not light up - decrease resistor. Again, I find it strange to believe that there is no appropriate resistor integrated but you're about to find out.,\n",
       "       The solution in the end is using a pull-down resistor set up since the switch provides power (3.3V in this case) to the ACC (accessory) terminal when on.  Whereas a simple on/off switch just connects one terminal to the other.Solution to my situation (and hopefully anyone else wanting to use a 3-terminal LED type switch):Wiring the switch properly per the specs: (-) terminal to ground rail/0V, (+) terminal to 3.3v constant (power rail), and the ACC (accessory) terminal to the GPIO pin through a 10k resistor (pull-down set up).Using a pull-down resistor instead of pull-up in my case (nice explanation here on pull-up and pull-down resistors: https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/projects/raspberrypi/tutorials/robot/buttons_and_switches/),\n",

       "       None of the answers previously presented here address the part \"without braking your system\".If you look at the packages installed in Raspbian, you will notice that some of them come from a collection that are essentially the Debian package collection ported to armv6. However, another part of the packages are the Foundation's own created packages that come from another collection.If you go and mix distributions by adding packages from testing with these other packages, there is a possibility that you end up in a situation where dependencies cannot be met. So, some package will not be able to install any version, or you might not be able to remove a package or whatever. In addition to that Debian's testing packages do contain more bugs and change quite rapidly (so the possibility of breakage is always eminent, even if it works now). Testing packages also do not get security patches and backports from the security team, although the actual package managers might incorporate such updates into their own code.Because of all of this, it is clearly better to use the older packages in the official repo, unless you have some packages that absolutely need to be of a newer version. In that case, it would be much more safer to backport only those packages by building the source against the official distribution's packages (if someone else has not already done it) than dist-upgrade to stretch/testing.,\n",

If you are tight on space (such as a portable project or a project where you need to connect a lot of jumpers,) then you probably will want to purchase the cables, as the ribbon cable takes up a lot of space. Instead of a 1:1 used GPIO to breadboard space, you'll have used up about a 15 by 3 area on your breadboard for the use of only a few GPIO pins.While there are only 13x2 GPIO pins, there is overlap on the edges of the jumper's board, leading to a loss of breadboard holes.,\n",

You can take the Pi64 Lite image and copy over its /boot/{kernel8.img,*.dtb,overlays,cmdline.txt,config.txt} along with the contents of /lib/modules/. Of course, back up your existing 32-bit kernel configuration beforehand. Reboot (fingers crossed). I was surprised that going from kernel 4.4 to 4.11 doesn't cause obvious problems.Set up MultiArch.sudo dpkg --add-architecture arm64 &amp;&amp; sudo apt updateInstall and run 64-bit Firefox:sudo apt install firefox:arm64 libcanberra-gtk3-module:arm64 topmenu-gtk3:arm64firefox(I initially got some warnings about missing Canberra and Topmenu GTK modules, hence the two additional packages.)Update: Somewhat quicker approach that works on a Pi 2: First, if you're on Ubuntu MATE Xenial download the Trusty .deb package and use dpkg --install. Next, disable Skia then go ahead and run 32-bit Firefox.,\n",

       "       To run a GUI, you need to execute it within a graphical user session. If your Pi is configured to boot into graphical mode and auto-login, it should suffice to put a .desktop file in one of the Desktop Autostart directories, e.g. ~/.config/autostart/ or `/etc/xdg/autostart.For your startup.desktop, you need a linebreak after [Desktop Entry]. Also triple-check that java path. In Debian/Raspian /usr/bin/java (which points to whatever JRE is currently defined as the default) is your best bet. But since /usr/bin is in the $PATH, you don't need the full path anyway.[Desktop Entry]Type=ApplicationName=JavaApplicationExec=java -jar /home/Cubiod/swingui.jarAs for the one instance per host rule, I would solve that in the application using a locking mechanism, which is answered on StackOverflow.,\n",

You have to start timidity in ALSA server mode:timidity -iA -B2,8 -Os -EFreverb=0This line is taken from the above link. The settings may vary, important is the -iA. The other parameters deal with buffering and disabling the reverb effect, to save CPU cycles.You can test the timidity server by using aplaymidi:aplaymidi -laplaymidi -p 65:0 somemidifile.midWhere 65:0 has to be replaced by the MIDI sequencer that you see after running aplaymidi -l.On the Python side, I cannot give you much advice, except reading the docs for the python-midi package.

I have to plan ahead for updates.I had to download a version of hostapd modified to support infrastructure AP mode on the Edimax adapter.Now that I've figured this out, I have 2 RPi 2Bs configured with two wifi adapters each, plus wired. I found all the relevant bits with a bit of googling. It just took patience to put them all together. I connect to the RPi for basic configuration using the Edimax in AP mode.Once connected, I configure the RPi as a wireless client to connect to the local wifi network, which changes from location to location, so can't be configured beforehand.Once connected as a wifi client to the local office network, I can ssh into the RPi and configure eth0 to work on the test network.Note that I have routing OFF for this.

Most cheaper digital camera still allow some IR through their filters which may be all you need.  Just find yourself a TV remote control or similar that that an LED IR bulb visible and point this at the camera and press any button.  You should see it change colour, if the filter isn't too powerful, thus saving you the need to remove the IR filter altogether.Previously I have found that PC line webcam PCL-300K was suitable for converting into an IR camera.

       "       The most accurate way to send pulses from the Pi is probably my pigpio library.  Examples include a Python morse code program transmitting to a LED, with the basic pulse length being 40 microseconds.  The pulses can be as short as 1 microsecond.,\n",
       "       James,I'm trying to do much the same with my own Daikin a/c.  Haven't progressed as far as implementation as I was trying to get a handle on the codes first.  I'm not sure how far you have progressed since April but a few things I have found that may be of use, if you haven't already discovered them.Chris Rieger has an interesting project which appears to be well documented at Chris Riegler. This didn't really solve my problems as I wanted to get a better idea of the codes sent but his project is very similar to the one I am looking at.  It certainly appears that lirc will work, though, but there a few items concerning a need to make sure that the formatting of lirc.conf is correct.  As with all things electrical the manufacturers create their own protocols for each device and given the remote control IDs change with models I suspect that the IR codes may also.  However I'm in the process of working through the codes from first principles at the moment and currently working out the header timings.Alex Bain also has several pages, from early 2013, looking into getting lirc working and on this page there is a note that the kernel was updated early in 2014, and around the time you were having problems, which solved a problem with timings.  Perhaps it is now working for you?  Seem to be several working projects in the comments section with info. ,\n",
       "       I've managed to document another Daikin remote control, or should I say almost fully document it.  Details are as follows:AirConditioner:Daikin FTY50GAV1A ~12years old, a split system with a ARC423A17 remote control.IR Receiver used:Built on a TSOP4136 IR receiver purchased from Jaycar.  Output to a 6mm jack socket which was then plugged into a professional audio DAC into my Windows machine.  Individual commands recorded into WAV files and compared.  Each wave file was flipped (phase reversed) before reading.Protocol:Much of the following uses your prior work on your Daikin remote with minor changes due to what is obviously an older remote.  As you noted earlier decimal numbers seem to be reversed but the positions of your commands in the 'message' are different and there are only 2 bursts not 3.Each message sent from the remote consists of 2 byte streams with a short gap in between.  Each byte stream consists of:-1   a start bit peak of 50µs length2   a start bit trough of 20µs3   a stream of message bits where 0 is a 5µs peak followed by 10µs trough                               and 1 is a 5µs peak followed by 20µs trough.4   a final peak of 5µsThe first byte stream consists of a consistent fixed stream of bits on all commands as a header.in bits &lt;10001000 01011011 11100100 00001111 10110000 00000000 11110000&gt;in hex &lt;88 5B E4 0F B0 00 F0&gt;The second byte stream consists of a constant length bit stream containing the encrypted commands in \"All-at-once\" form.  I did note that occasionally the first \"start bit peak\" on ths stream was only 15-20µs in length rather than the standard 50µs in the table above.  As I had no intention of using the in-built timer of the aircon I did not investigate these bytes which I assume in my case are bytes 8 and 9 of the 2nd message stream.The second byte stream consists of a variable bit stream of constant length (13 bytes).  The first 5 bytes (or 40 bits) are constant for all commands with the first 3 bytes a repeat of the first messagein bits &lt;10001000 01011011 11100100 00000000 11001011&gt;in hex  &lt;88 5B E4 00 CB&gt;Thereafter the bit stream depends on the parameters being set.

       "       In general, if someone states that, he should also provide some arguments about his claim. Otherwise, you should ignore such statement.I am using such adapter without problems and I really have no idea why it could be wrong. The only thing I imagine is that many such adapters are not really good quality and you can easily break one.,\n",
       "       There's no reason why this should be true. As far as the Pi is concerned, an SD card and a MicroSD card + adapter are exactly the same thing.I could imagine however that MicroSD cards may not perform favorably compared to a full-size SD card and in this respect it might not be a brilliant idea, but this is definitely not a \"should not\" and more of a \"you'd be better off if you didn't\" kind of thing.,\n",
       "       I've been using a micro sd card in an adapter for the past few months and have had no problems. There are even adapters that fit flush with the side of the Pi so there is no bit 'sticking out'. It's fine to use a micro.Two adapters available:US-based:http://www.adafruit.com/products/966UK-basedhttp://www.modmypi.com/shop/sd-cards-and-adaptors/raspberry-pi-micro-sd-card-adaptor,\n",
       "       Actually - I also use one myself. And the modmypi.com website even sells a special adapter for them. I think as long as it is large enough and at least a class 6 (don't quote me on that part) it should work.,\n",
       "       In some cases, the signal integrity of SD cards can be marginal - the signals have to come off the SoC, down the PCB traces, through the socket, and into the SD card.  SD cards, especially fast cards, can be clocked at up to 100MHz.  MicroSD adaptors are often designed to be as cheap as possible, and may make the signal integrity worse.  For example, I have a £1 USB card reader that will read MicroSD in its own dedicated MicroSD slot, but not in an adaptor in the normal SD slot (which reads full SD cards just fine).  If you open up an adaptor, you find it's just a series of metal pins in plastic - no shielding or any other signal protection.Now the Pi isn't a £1 card reader, but the same issues may apply - the more connectors you have, the higher chance you have of pushing it over the edge in high speed modes.  If you look at dmesg and see SD command errors, that's where you'll see problems if they occur.  It's more likely if you're thrashing the card (eg using as swap) rather than people who just use them for moving photos about.,\n",
       "       The full size, standard SD cards came first...As products that use this media became smaller,for example action sports camera's and suchlike..,then the SD card required, also became smaller...The adapter just means that you can use both types in older or different types of devices, or in your computers, or Standard SD ( full size card readers ) Just my opinion anyway........,\n",
       "       BCM2835 ARM Peripherals page 102 is probably the place to start.I'm surprised that SPI CEx is confusing.  SPI is a well known protocol available on many microprocessors including PICs and Atmels.  CE (chip enable) is a synonym for SS (slave select).GCLK (general clock) generate a general purpose clock (square wave of user defined frequency).,\n",
       "       GPIO_GCLK appears to be one of a group that includes GPIO_GEN0 through GPIO_GEN7.Could possibly be a clock enabled GPIO pin set.,\n",
       "       The 40 pin expansion header provides power and ground rails as well as 28 GPIOs (general purpose inputs outputs).The GPIOs are controllable IO lines and as the name suggests may be individually configured to be inputs or outputs.  The inputs may be used to read sensors such as switches, ADCs, thermometers etc.  The outputs may be used to control motors (DC, servo, stepper etc.) and switch devices on and off via transistors etc.The possibilities are literally endless.  Look through issues of the Magpi to get some ideas.One thing you can't do is SATA.  You will not be able to write software to switch the GPIOs at the speeds you need.,\n",
       "       Pin headers in general are just what the name suggests: pins. Those pins can be connected to various things, such as power lines, data lines and signal lines. As already explained, the one on the Pi is documented and it is known what they all do. If you check out a different device, you might see headers with pins in them as well, but unless they are documented or you traced out their connections, you won't actually know what they are for.Some pin headers have power connections and nothing else. Some might only have audio, or only a few GPIO connections. GPIO stands for General Purpose Input/Output, which are basically programmable connections. GPIO is very flexible, but in general is not capable of high speeds (as in: not as fast as PCI Express or even USB) or high voltages. This also means that you probably won't have any luck trying to program SATA-over-GPIO as it's most likely not going to work at all due to the speed being too low and unpredictable from the software side of things to actually communicate with a SATA device.Pin headers can also be explained as simply being \"plugs\". They have no standard use or universal system and are commonly pretty device-specific.],\n",

       "Looks like there is thread here that discusses a very similar/same problem you describe. Extract from that link  by ddevejian » Thu Apr 02, 2015 2:11 am  All right, its working.    I found a couple of comments in other forums that suggested that the \"Family 0 for 00-XX00000000000.YY is not registered\" message is not an error, but typical behavior for the 1wire driver when nothing is attached.     Based off of that, I reattached my circuit and started to double check everything. Looking at the datasheet for the DS18B20, the input voltage is 3.0 to 5.5. Thinking that perhaps the 3v3 pin wasnt delivering sufficient voltage for whatever reason, I tried the 5v0 on pin 2. Still no love. However, when I changed the ground pin from pin 9 to pin 6, low and behold it started working. (Ive since moved back to the 3v3 on pin 1 for power and it continued to work.) For the moment Im going to assume there is a break in my ribbon cable or the T-Connector I used to connect the GPIO to the breadboard. Digging into exactly whats happening there will be a labor for another day.    I appreciate your help, Joan.My guess is it is the same Joan who is top rated contributer here. Might want to thank him/her if the solution works for you."
